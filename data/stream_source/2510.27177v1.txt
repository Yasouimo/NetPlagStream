In this paper, we study the problem of online sparse linear regression (OSLR) where the algorithms are restricted to accessing only $k$ out of $d$ attributes per instance for prediction, which was proved to be NP-hard. Previous work gave polynomial-time algorithms assuming the data matrix satisfies the linear independence of features, the compatibility condition, or the restricted isometry property. We introduce a new polynomial-time algorithm, which significantly improves previous regret bounds (Ito et al., 2017) under the compatibility condition that is weaker than the other two assumptions. The improvements benefit from a tighter convergence rate of the $\ell_1$-norm error of our estimators. Our algorithm leverages the well-studied Dantzig Selector, but importantly with several novel techniques, including an algorithm-dependent sampling scheme for estimating the covariance matrix, an adaptive parameter tuning scheme, and a batching online Newton step with careful initializations. We also give novel and non-trivial analyses, including an induction method for analyzing the $\ell_1$-norm error, careful analyses on the covariance of non-independent random variables, and a decomposition on the regret. We further extend our algorithm to OSLR with additional observations where the algorithms can observe additional $k_0$ attributes after each prediction, and improve previous regret bounds (Kale et al., 2017; Ito et al., 2017).

Various techniques can be employed to determine the temperature of magnetic transformation, whether it be the Curie or Neel temperature. The standard procedure typically involves creating alloys with defined compositions and performing measurements experimentally. Alternatively, these temperatures can be predicted based on a material known physical and chemical properties prior to experiments. We identified an optimal feature set and selected the most effective algorithm. Our findings show that the Voting Ensemble model, when combined with Monte Carlo cross-validation, achieves the highest prediction accuracy. The normalized root mean squared error serves as the primary performance metric. For implementation, we utilize the Azure Machine Learning framework for its robust computational and integration capabilities. This approach offers an efficient and reliable strategy for designing and predicting the Curie temperature of ternary alloys. The paper also highlights potential applications of the model and its extensions for other systems.

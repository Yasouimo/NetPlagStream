Learning causality from observational data has received increasing interest across various scientific fields. However, most existing methods assume the absence of latent confounders and restrict the underlying causal graph to be acyclic, assumptions that are often violated in many real-world applications. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a novel framework for causal discovery that accommodates both cycles and latent confounders. By leveraging the identifiability results from noisy independent component analysis and recent advances in factor analysis, we establish the unique causal identifiability under mild conditions. Building on this foundation, we further develop a fully Bayesian approach for causal structure learning, called BayCausal, and evaluate its identifiability, utility, and superior performance against state-of-the-art alternatives through extensive simulation studies. Application to a dataset from the Women's Interagency HIV Study yields interpretable and clinically meaningful insights. To facilitate broader applications, we have implemented BayCausal in an R package, BayCausal, which is the first publicly available software capable of achieving unique causal identification in the presence of both cycles and latent confounders.

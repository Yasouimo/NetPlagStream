Agent-based models help explain stock price dynamics as emergent phenomena driven by interacting investors. In this modeling tradition, investor behavior has typically been captured by two distinct mechanisms -- learning and heterogeneous preferences -- which have been explored as separate paradigms in prior studies. However, the impact of their joint modeling on the resulting collective dynamics remains largely unexplored. We develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework in which agents endowed with heterogeneous risk aversion, time discounting, and information access collectively learn trading strategies within a unified shared-policy framework. The experiment reveals that (i) learning with heterogeneous preferences drives agents to develop strategies aligned with their individual traits, fostering behavioral differentiation and niche specialization within the market, and (ii) the interactions by the differentiated agents are essential for the emergence of realistic market dynamics such as fat-tailed price fluctuations and volatility clustering. This study presents a constructive paradigm for financial market modeling in which the joint design of heterogeneous preferences and learning mechanisms enables two-stage emergence: individual behavior and the collective market dynamics.

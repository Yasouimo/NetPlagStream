The fusion of cognitive radio (CR) and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), enabled by stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs), offers a promising path for multi-functional programmable front ends in 6G and beyond. In this paper we propose a novel CR-ISAC framework that leverages an SIM integrated with the secondary base station (SB) to learn and realize optimal beampatterns that simultaneously (i) minimize the Bayesian Cramér-Rao bound (BCRB) for localizing a secondary user equipment (SU) and (ii) limit averaged interference at primary user equipments (PUs) so that spectral efficiency loss is constrained, with the target of at most a few percent degradation. We propose an efficient alternating optimization-based algorithm to obtain the optimal end-to-end transmission response of the SIM for all orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) subcarriers. Drawing an analogy between the layered SIM architecture and deep neural networks, we define a beampattern- matching loss, derive analytical gradients for backpropagation, and implement a learning-based optimization of the SIM coefficients using a mini-batch Adam optimizer. A complexity analysis is provided, and extensive numerical experiments are performed to evaluate the proposed CR-ISAC framework. The results show that the proposed SIM coefficient optimization methods attain near-optimal performance in terms of both the SU BCRB localization metric and the PUs average spectral efficiency when the SIM has a sufficient number of layers, and they substantially outperform traditional single-layer reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) designs.

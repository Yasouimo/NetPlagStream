The pursuit of immersive and structurally aware multimedia experiences has intensified interest in sensing modalities that reconstruct objects beyond the limits of visible light. Conventional optical pipelines degrade under occlusion or low illumination, motivating the use of radio-frequency (RF) sensing, whose electromagnetic waves penetrate materials and encode both geometric and compositional information. Yet, uncontrolled multipath propagation restricts reconstruction accuracy. Recent advances in Programmable Wireless Environments (PWEs) mitigate this limitation by enabling software-defined manipulation of propagation through Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs), thereby providing controllable illumination diversity. Building on this capability, this work introduces a PWE-driven RF framework for three-dimensional object reconstruction using material-aware spherical primitives. The proposed approach combines RIS-enabled field synthesis with a Detection Transformer (DETR) that infers spatial and material parameters directly from extracted RF features. Simulation results confirm the framework's ability to approximate object geometries and classify material composition with an overall accuracy of 79.35%, marking an initial step toward programmable and physically grounded RF-based 3D object composition visualization.

Graph Neural Networks learn on graph-structured data by iteratively aggregating local neighborhood information. While this local message passing paradigm imparts a powerful inductive bias and exploits graph sparsity, it also yields three key challenges: (i) oversquashing of long-range information, (ii) oversmoothing of node representations, and (iii) limited expressive power. In this work we inject randomized global embeddings of node features, which we term \textit{Sketched Random Features}, into standard GNNs, enabling them to efficiently capture long-range dependencies. The embeddings are unique, distance-sensitive, and topology-agnostic -- properties which we analytically and empirically show alleviate the aforementioned limitations when injected into GNNs. Experimental results on real-world graph learning tasks confirm that this strategy consistently improves performance over baseline GNNs, offering both a standalone solution and a complementary enhancement to existing techniques such as graph positional encodings.

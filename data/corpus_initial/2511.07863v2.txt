Large language models now draft news, legal analyses, and software code with human-level fluency. At the same time, regulations such as the EU AI Act mandate that each synthetic passage carry an imperceptible, machine-verifiable mark for provenance. Conventional logit-based watermarks satisfy this requirement by selecting a pseudorandom green vocabulary at every decoding step and boosting its logits, yet the random split can exclude the highest-probability token and thus erode fluency. WaterMod mitigates this limitation through a probability-aware modular rule. The vocabulary is first sorted in descending model probability; the resulting ranks are then partitioned by the residue rank mod k, which distributes adjacent-and therefore semantically similar-tokens across different classes. A fixed bias of small magnitude is applied to one selected class. In the zero-bit setting (k=2), an entropy-adaptive gate selects either the even or the odd parity as the green list. Because the top two ranks fall into different parities, this choice embeds a detectable signal while guaranteeing that at least one high-probability token remains available for sampling. In the multi-bit regime (k>2), the current payload digit d selects the color class whose ranks satisfy rank mod k = d. Biasing the logits of that class embeds exactly one base-k digit per decoding step, thereby enabling fine-grained provenance tracing. The same modular arithmetic therefore supports both binary attribution and rich payloads. Experimental results demonstrate that WaterMod consistently attains strong watermark detection performance while maintaining generation quality in both zero-bit and multi-bit settings. This robustness holds across a range of tasks, including natural language generation, mathematical reasoning, and code synthesis.

This paper addresses the Quadratic Multiple Constraints Variable-Sized Bin Packing Problem (QMC-VSBPP), a challenging combinatorial optimization problem that generalizes the classical bin packing by incorporating multiple capacity dimensions, heterogeneous bin types, and quadratic interaction costs between items. We propose two complementary methods that advance the current state-of-the-art. First, a linearized mathematical formulation is introduced to eliminate quadratic terms, enabling the use of exact solvers such as Gurobi to compute strong lower bounds - reported here for the first time for this problem. Second, we develop RKO-ACO, a continuous-domain Ant Colony Optimization algorithm within the Random-Key Optimization framework, enhanced with adaptive Q-learning parameter control and efficient local search. Extensive computational experiments on benchmark instances show that the proposed linearized model produces significantly tighter lower bounds than the original quadratic formulation, while RKO-ACO consistently matches or improves upon all best-known solutions in the literature, establishing new upper bounds for large-scale instances. These results provide new reference values for future studies and demonstrate the effectiveness of evolutionary and random-key metaheuristic approaches for solving complex quadratic packing problems.

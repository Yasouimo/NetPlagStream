Progress in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) requires challenging benchmarks that assess the limits of current methods. However, existing benchmarks often target narrow short-horizon challenges that do not adequately stress the long-term dependencies and generalization capabilities inherent in many multi-agent systems. To address this, we first present \textit{Craftax-MA}: an extension of the popular open-ended RL environment, Craftax, that supports multiple agents and evaluates a wide range of general abilities within a single environment. Written in JAX, \textit{Craftax-MA} is exceptionally fast with a training run using 250 million environment interactions completing in under an hour. To provide a more compelling challenge for MARL, we also present \textit{Craftax-Coop}, an extension introducing heterogeneous agents, trading and more mechanics that require complex cooperation among agents for success. We provide analysis demonstrating that existing algorithms struggle with key challenges in this benchmark, including long-horizon credit assignment, exploration and cooperation, and argue for its potential to drive long-term research in MARL.

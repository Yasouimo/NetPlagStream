Mineral dust aerosols strongly influence Earth's climate by acting as ice-nucleating particles (INPs). Feldspar minerals, particularly K-feldspar, are recognized as dominant INPs, and a previous study attributed this behavior to (100) surfaces exposed at defects. Using machine-learning molecular dynamics simulations, we systematically investigate ice nucleation on all K-feldspar surfaces. We identify the (110) surface, exposed at defects such as steps, as the most active plane for ice formation. This surface uniquely structures interfacial water into an arrangement resembling that on the (110) surface of cubic ice, providing an optimal template for nucleation. Using advanced sampling, we directly observe the formation of clusters with cubic-ice structure and their orientation agrees with experiment. These results provide a microscopic explanation of how ice forms in our planet's atmosphere.

Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, which measure changes in blood volume in the skin using light, have recently gained attention in biometric authentication because of their non-invasive acquisition, inherent liveness detection, and suitability for low-cost wearable devices. However, PPG signal quality is challenged by motion artifacts, illumination changes, and inter-subject physiological variability, making robust feature extraction and classification crucial. This study proposes a lightweight and cost-effective biometric authentication framework based on PPG signals extracted from low-frame-rate fingertip videos. The CFIHSR dataset, comprising PPG recordings from 46 subjects at a sampling rate of 14 Hz, is employed for evaluation. The raw PPG signals undergo a standard preprocessing pipeline involving baseline drift removal, motion artifact suppression using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), bandpass filtering, Fourier-based resampling, and amplitude normalization. To generate robust representations, each one-dimensional PPG segment is converted into a two-dimensional time-frequency scalogram via the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), effectively capturing transient cardiovascular dynamics. We developed a hybrid deep learning model, termed CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM, by combining spatial features from the Convolutional Vision Transformer (CVT) and ConvMixer branches with temporal features from a Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM). The experimental results on 46 subjects demonstrate an authentication accuracy of 98%, validating the robustness of the model to noise and variability between subjects. Due to its efficiency, scalability, and inherent liveness detection capability, the proposed system is well-suited for real-world mobile and embedded biometric security applications.

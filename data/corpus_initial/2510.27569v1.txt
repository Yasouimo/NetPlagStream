Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at reasoning and generation but are inherently limited by static pretraining data, resulting in factual inaccuracies and weak adaptability to new information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this issue by grounding LLMs in external knowledge; However, the effectiveness of RAG critically depends on whether the model can adequately access relevant information. Existing RAG systems rely on a single retriever with fixed top-k selection, restricting access to a narrow and static subset of the corpus. As a result, this single-retriever paradigm has become the primary bottleneck for comprehensive external information acquisition, especially in tasks requiring corpus-level reasoning. To overcome this limitation, we propose MARAG-R1, a reinforcement-learned multi-tool RAG framework that enables LLMs to dynamically coordinate multiple retrieval mechanisms for broader and more precise information access. MARAG-R1 equips the model with four retrieval tools -- semantic search, keyword search, filtering, and aggregation -- and learns both how and when to use them through a two-stage training process: supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning. This design allows the model to interleave reasoning and retrieval, progressively gathering sufficient evidence for corpus-level synthesis. Experiments on GlobalQA, HotpotQA, and 2WikiMultiHopQA demonstrate that MARAG-R1 substantially outperforms strong baselines and achieves new state-of-the-art results in corpus-level reasoning tasks.

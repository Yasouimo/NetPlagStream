Next-generation wireless communication systems must support ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) service for mission-critical applications. Meeting stringent URLLC requirements is challenging, especially for two-hop cooperative communication. In this paper, we develop an adaptive transmission design for a two-hop relaying communication system. Each hop transmission adaptively configures its transmission parameters separately, including numerology, mini-slot size, and modulation and coding scheme, for reliable packet transmission within a strict latency constraint. We formulate the hop-specific transceiver configuration as a Markov decision process (MDP) and propose a dual-agent reinforcement learning-based cooperative latency-aware transmission (DRL-CoLA) algorithm to learn latency-aware transmission policies in a distributed manner. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm achieves the near-optimal reliability while satisfying strict latency requirements.

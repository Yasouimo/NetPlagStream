Breaking the diffraction limit in optical imaging is crucial for resolving subwavelength details in a wide range of applications, where superoscillatory imaging and subtraction imaging are two common strategies for surpassing conventional resolution limits. We propose an end-to-end deep learning framework that integrates superoscillatory focusing and subtraction imaging into a single jointly-optimized vectorial Debye integral neural network pipeline, eliminating the traditional two-step acquisition and manual weighting process. With this end-to-end neural network, we further improve the focusing capability of the system to the sub-100-nm regime, enabling deep-subwavelength imaging resolution.

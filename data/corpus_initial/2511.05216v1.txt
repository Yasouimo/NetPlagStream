Modern power systems require fast and accurate dynamic simulations for stability assessment, digital twins, and real-time control, but classical ODE solvers are often too slow for large-scale or online applications. We propose a neural-operator framework for surrogate modeling of power system components, using Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) to learn mappings from system states and time-varying inputs to full trajectories without step-by-step integration. To enhance generalization and data efficiency, we introduce Physics-Informed DeepONets (PI-DeepONets), which embed the residuals of governing equations into the training loss. Our results show that DeepONets, and especially PI-DeepONets, achieve accurate predictions under diverse scenarios, providing over 30 times speedup compared to high-order ODE solvers. Benchmarking against Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) highlights superior stability and scalability. Our results demonstrate neural operators as a promising path toward real-time, physics-aware simulation of power system dynamics.

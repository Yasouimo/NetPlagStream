The rapid emergence of Generative AI, particularly ChatGPT, has sparked a global debate on the future of education, often characterized by alarmism and speculation. Moving beyond this, this study investigates the structured, grounded perspectives of a key stakeholder group: university educators. It proposes a novel theoretical model that conceptualizes the educational environment as a "Learning Space" composed of seven subspaces to systematically identify the impact of AI integration. This framework was operationalized through a quantitative survey of 140 Russian university educators, with responses analyzed using a binary flagging system to measure acceptance across key indicators. The results reveal a strong but conditional consensus: a majority of educators support ChatGPT's integration, contingent upon crucial factors such as the transformation of assessment methods and the availability of plagiarism detection tools. However, significant concerns persist regarding its impact on critical thinking. Educators largely reject the notion that AI diminishes their importance, viewing their role as evolving from information-deliverer to facilitator of critical engagement. The study concludes that ChatGPT acts less as a destroyer of education and more as a catalyst for its necessary evolution, and proposes the PIPE Model (Pedagogy, Infrastructure, Policy, Education) as a strategic framework for its responsible integration. This research provides a data-driven, model-based analysis of educator attitudes, offering a nuanced alternative to the polarized discourse surrounding AI in education.

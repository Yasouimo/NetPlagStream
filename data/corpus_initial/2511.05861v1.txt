This paper investigates a time-inconsistent portfolio selection problem in the incomplete mar ket model, integrating expected utility maximization with risk control. The objective functional
  balances the expected utility and variance on log returns, giving rise to time inconsistency and
  motivating the search of a time-consistent equilibrium strategy. We characterize the equilibrium
  via a coupled quadratic backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) system and establish
  the existence theory in two special cases: (i) two Brownian motions driven the price dynamics
  and the factor process are independent with $ρ= 0$; (ii) the trading strategy is constrained to
  be bounded. For the general case with correlation coefficient $ρ\neq 0$, we introduce the notion
  of an approximate time-consistent equilibrium. By employing the solution structure from the
  equilibrium in the case $ρ= 0$, we can construct an approximate time-consistent equilibrium in
  the general case with an error of order $O(ρ^2)$. Numerical examples and financial insights based
  on deep learning algorithms are also presented.

Riesz regression has garnered attention as a tool in debiased machine learning for causal and structural parameter estimation (Chernozhukov et al., 2021). This study shows that Riesz regression is closely related to direct density-ratio estimation (DRE) in important cases, including average treat- ment effect (ATE) estimation. Specifically, the idea and objective in Riesz regression coincide with the one in least-squares importance fitting (LSIF, Kanamori et al., 2009) in direct density-ratio estimation. While Riesz regression is general in the sense that it can be applied to Riesz representer estimation in a wide class of problems, the equivalence with DRE allows us to directly import exist- ing results in specific cases, including convergence-rate analyses, the selection of loss functions via Bregman-divergence minimization, and regularization techniques for flexible models, such as neural networks. Conversely, insights about the Riesz representer in debiased machine learning broaden the applications of direct density-ratio estimation methods. This paper consolidates our prior results in Kato (2025a) and Kato (2025b).

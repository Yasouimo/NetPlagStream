Sentiment analysis using deep learning and pre-trained language models (PLMs) has gained significant traction due to their ability to capture rich contextual representations. However, existing approaches often underperform in scenarios involving nuanced emotional cues, domain shifts, and imbalanced sentiment distributions. We argue that these limitations stem from inadequate semantic grounding, poor generalization to diverse linguistic patterns, and biases toward dominant sentiment classes. To overcome these challenges, we propose CISEA-MRFE, a novel PLM-based framework integrating Contextual Instruction (CI), Semantic Enhancement Augmentation (SEA), and Multi-Refined Feature Extraction (MRFE). CI injects domain-aware directives to guide sentiment disambiguation; SEA improves robustness through sentiment-consistent paraphrastic augmentation; and MRFE combines a Scale-Adaptive Depthwise Encoder (SADE) for multi-scale feature specialization with an Emotion Evaluator Context Encoder (EECE) for affect-aware sequence modeling. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that CISEA-MRFE consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving relative improvements in accuracy of up to 4.6% on IMDb, 6.5% on Yelp, 30.3% on Twitter, and 4.1% on Amazon. These results validate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our approach for sentiment classification across varied domains.

Vision Transformers have been tremendously successful in computer vision tasks. However, their large computational, memory, and energy demands are a challenge for edge inference on FPGAs -- a field that has seen a recent surge in demand. We recognize the benefits of recent works on logic and Look Up Table (LUT) based networks, such as LogicNets, NeuraLUT, DWN, among others, in offering models that simultaneously reduce both the memory and compute footprints. However, these models natively do not perform well on common vision tasks, such as CIFAR-10/100. In this work, we propose LL-ViT, a novel edge optimized vision transformer design that integrates layers of LUT neurons within the transformer architecture. Based on our characterization that reveals that a majority of model weights and computations are from the channel mixer (MLP layer), we design an alternate LUT-based channel mixer, and simultaneously develop an FPGA-based accelerator for LL-ViT. Contrary to some attempts to replace each multiplication with a table lookup, our architecture utilizes a neural learning approach which natively learns the LUT functions. This approach allows for reduced model sizes, and a computational and energy-efficient inference solution for vision transformer models. Evaluating on edge-suitable workloads, we achieve accuracies of 95.5% on CIFAR-10, 78.8% on CIFAR-100, and 60.9% on Tiny-ImageNet datasets, comparable to the baseline transformer. LL-ViT eliminates over 60% of the model weights and 50% of the multiplications in the model, and achieves 1.9x energy efficiency and 1.3x lower latency over an integer quantized ViT accelerator, while also offering superior throughput against prior works at a 10.9W power budget.

The performance of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in partially observable environments depends on effectively aggregating information from observations, communications, and reward signals. While most existing multi-agent systems primarily rely on rewards as the only feedback for policy training, our research shows that introducing auxiliary predictive tasks can significantly enhance learning efficiency and stability. We propose Belief-based Predictive Auxiliary Learning (BEPAL), a framework that incorporates auxiliary training objectives to support policy optimization. BEPAL follows the centralized training with decentralized execution paradigm. Each agent learns a belief model that predicts unobservable state information, such as other agents' rewards or motion directions, alongside its policy model. By enriching hidden state representations with information that does not directly contribute to immediate reward maximization, this auxiliary learning process stabilizes MARL training and improves overall performance. We evaluate BEPAL in the predator-prey environment and Google Research Football, where it achieves an average improvement of about 16 percent in performance metrics and demonstrates more stable convergence compared to baseline methods.

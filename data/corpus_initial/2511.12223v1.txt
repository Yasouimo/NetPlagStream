Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a mounting global health crisis, requiring rapid and reliable prediction frameworks that capture its complex evolutionary dynamics. Traditional antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST), while accurate, remains laborious and time-consuming, limiting its clinical scalability. Existing computational approaches, primarily reliant on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based analysis, fail to account for evolutionary drivers such as horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and genome-level interactions.
  This study introduces a novel Evolutionary Mixture of Experts (Evo-MoE) framework that integrates genomic sequence analysis, machine learning, and evolutionary algorithms to model and predict AMR evolution. A Mixture of Experts model, trained on labeled genomic data for multiple antibiotics, serves as the predictive core, estimating the likelihood of resistance for each genome. This model is embedded as a fitness function within a Genetic Algorithm designed to simulate AMR development across generations. Each genome, encoded as an individual in the population, undergoes mutation, crossover, and selection guided by predicted resistance probabilities.
  The resulting evolutionary trajectories reveal dynamic pathways of resistance acquisition, offering mechanistic insights into genomic evolution under selective antibiotic pressure. Sensitivity analysis of mutation rates and selection pressures demonstrates the model's robustness and biological plausibility. Validation against curated AMR databases and literature evidence further substantiates the framework's predictive fidelity.
  This integrative approach bridges genomic prediction and evolutionary simulation, offering a powerful tool for understanding and anticipating AMR dynamics, and potentially guiding rational antibiotic design and policy interventions.

Nuclear star clusters represent some of the most extreme collisional environments in the Universe. A typical nuclear star cluster harbors a supermassive black hole at its center, which accelerates stars to high speeds ($\gtrsim 100$-$1000$ km/s) in a region where millions of other stars reside. Direct collisions occur frequently in such high-density environments, where they can shape the stellar populations and drive the evolution of the cluster. We present a suite of a couple hundred high-resolution smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of collisions between $1$ M$_\odot$ stars, at impact speeds representative of galactic nuclei. We use our SPH dataset to develop physically-motivated fitting formulae for predicting collision outcomes. While collision-driven mass loss has been examined in detail in the literature, we present a new framework for understanding the effects of "hit-and-run" collisions on a star's trajectory. We demonstrate that the change in stellar velocity follows the tidal-dissipation limit for grazing encounters, while the deflection angle is well-approximated by point-particle dynamics for periapses $\gtrsim0.3$ times the stellar radii. We use our SPH dataset to test two machine learning (ML) algorithms, k-Nearest Neighbors and neural networks, for predicting collision outcomes and properties. We find that the neural network out-performs k-Nearest Neighbors and delivers results on par with and in some cases exceeding the accuracy of our fitting formulae. We conclude that both fitting formulae and ML have merits for modeling collisions in dense stellar environments, however ML may prove more effective as the parameter space of initial conditions expands.

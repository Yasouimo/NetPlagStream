In multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), accurately modeling the intricate dependencies among multiple variables remains a significant challenge due to the inherent limitations of traditional approaches. Most existing models adopt either \textbf{channel-independent} (CI) or \textbf{channel-dependent} (CD) strategies, each presenting distinct drawbacks. CI methods fail to leverage the potential insights from inter-channel interactions, resulting in models that may not fully exploit the underlying statistical dependencies present in the data. Conversely, CD approaches often incorporate too much extraneous information, risking model overfitting and predictive inefficiency. To address these issues, we introduce the Adaptive Forecasting Transformer (\textbf{Adapformer}), an advanced Transformer-based framework that merges the benefits of CI and CD methodologies through effective channel management. The core of Adapformer lies in its dual-stage encoder-decoder architecture, which includes the \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{C}hannel \textbf{E}nhancer (\textbf{ACE}) for enriching embedding processes and the \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{C}hannel \textbf{F}orecaster (\textbf{ACF}) for refining the predictions. ACE enhances token representations by selectively incorporating essential dependencies, while ACF streamlines the decoding process by focusing on the most relevant covariates, substantially reducing noise and redundancy. Our rigorous testing on diverse datasets shows that Adapformer achieves superior performance over existing models, enhancing both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, thus making it state-of-the-art in MTSF.

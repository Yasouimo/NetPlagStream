Action Quality Assessment (AQA) requires fine-grained understanding of human motion and precise evaluation of pose similarity. This paper proposes a topology-aware Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) framework, termed GCN-PSN, which models the human skeleton as a graph to learn discriminative, topology-sensitive pose embeddings. Using a Siamese architecture trained with a contrastive regression objective, our method outperforms coordinate-based baselines and achieves competitive performance on AQA-7 and FineDiving benchmarks. Experimental results and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of leveraging skeletal topology for pose similarity and action quality assessment.

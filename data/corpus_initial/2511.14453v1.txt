Adult language learning varies greatly among individuals. Traditionally associated with frontotemporal language regions, this variability is increasingly seen as stemming from distributed brain networks. However, the role of these networks and their topological organization in explaining these differences remains unclear. We hypothesize that graph-theory-based network analysis of intrinsic multimodal connectivities across multiple networks explains overall and component-specific variations in language learning. We tested this in 101 healthy adults who underwent resting-state fMRI, structural MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging before seven days of six artificial language training tasks. We identified one dominant general learning component shared across tasks and five task-specific ones. Cross-validated predictive models used multimodal multi-network graph-theoretic metrics to predict final learning outcomes (LO) and rates (LR). We significantly predicted the LO and LR of the general component, which were primarily contributed by dorsal attention and frontoparietal networks. Nodal local efficiency was the most consistent predictor, with additional contributions from node clustering coefficient and network centrality for LR, highlighting local robustness, mesoscale network segregation, and global influence in explaining individual differences. Only task-specific word learning LO was predictable, relying on default mode and frontoparietal hubs with high betweenness centrality and efficiency. These findings demonstrate that intrinsic network topologies underlie differences in language learning success, supporting a multiple-systems hypothesis in which attentional-control networks interact with default and subcortical systems to shape learning trajectories. This advances mechanistic understanding and paves the way for personalized language education.

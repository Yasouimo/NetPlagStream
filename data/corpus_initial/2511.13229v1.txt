The manifold hypothesis posits that high-dimensional data typically resides on low-dimensional sub spaces. In this paper, we assume manifold hypothesis to investigate graph-based semi-supervised learning
  methods. In particular, we examine Laplace Learning in the Wasserstein space, extending the classical
  notion of graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithms from finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces to
  an infinite-dimensional setting. To achieve this, we prove variational convergence of a discrete graph p- Dirichlet energy to its continuum counterpart. In addition, we characterize the Laplace-Beltrami operator
  on asubmanifold of the Wasserstein space. Finally, we validate the proposed theoretical framework through
  numerical experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, demonstrating the consistency of our classification performance in high-dimensional settings.

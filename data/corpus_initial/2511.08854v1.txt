Recent work in mechanistic interpretability has shown that decomposing models in parameter space may yield clean handles for analysis and intervention. Previous methods have demonstrated successful applications on a wide range of toy models, but the gap to "real models" has not yet been bridged. In this work, we extend Stochastic Parameter Decomposition (SPD) to Transformer models, proposing an updated causal importance function suited for sequential data and a new loss function. We demonstrate that SPD can successfully decompose a toy induction-head model and recover the expected 2-step circuit. We also show that applying SPD to GPT-2-small can successfully locate subcomponents corresponding to interpretable concepts like "golf" and "basketball". These results take the first step in the direction of extending SPD to modern models, and show that we can use the method to surface interpretable parameter-space mechanisms.

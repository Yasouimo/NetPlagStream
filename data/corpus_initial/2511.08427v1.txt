Deep learning has brought significant advancements to X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) reconstruction, offering solutions to challenges arising from modern imaging technologies. These developments benefit from methods that combine classical reconstruction techniques with data-driven approaches. Differentiable operators play a key role in this integration by enabling end-to-end optimization and the incorporation of physical modeling within neural networks.
  In this work, we present an updated version of PYRO-NN, a Python-based library for differentiable CT reconstruction. The updated framework extends compatibility to PyTorch and introduces native CUDA kernel support for efficient projection and back-projection operations across parallel, fan, and cone-beam geometries. Additionally, it includes tools for simulating imaging artifacts, modeling arbitrary acquisition trajectories, and creating flexible, end-to-end trainable pipelines through a high-level Python API.

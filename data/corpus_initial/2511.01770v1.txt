Robotic grasping under uncertainty remains a fundamental challenge due to its uncertain and contact-rich nature. Traditional rigid robotic hands, with limited degrees of freedom and compliance, rely on complex model-based and heavy feedback controllers to manage such interactions. Soft robots, by contrast, exhibit embodied mechanical intelligence: their underactuated structures and passive flexibility of their whole body, naturally accommodate uncertain contacts and enable adaptive behaviors. To harness this capability, we propose a lightweight actuation-space learning framework that infers distributional control representations for whole-body soft robotic grasping, directly from deterministic demonstrations using a flow matching model (Rectified Flow),without requiring dense sensing or heavy control loops. Using only 30 demonstrations (less than 8% of the reachable workspace), the learned policy achieves a 97.5% grasp success rate across the whole workspace, generalizes to grasped-object size variations of +-33%, and maintains stable performance when the robot's dynamic response is directly adjusted by scaling the execution time from 20% to 200%. These results demonstrate that actuation-space learning, by leveraging its passive redundant DOFs and flexibility, converts the body's mechanics into functional control intelligence and substantially reduces the burden on central controllers for this uncertain-rich task.

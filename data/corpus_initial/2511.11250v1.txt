Smart contracts have emerged as key components within decentralized environments, enabling the automation of transactions through self-executing programs. While these innovations offer significant advantages, they also present potential drawbacks if the smart contract code is not carefully designed and implemented. This paper investigates the capability of large language models (LLMs) to detect OWASP-inspired vulnerabilities in smart contracts beyond the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) ecosystem, focusing specifically on Solana and Algorand. Given the lack of labeled datasets for non-EVM platforms, we design a synthetic dataset of annotated smart contract snippets in Rust (for Solana) and PyTeal (for Algorand), structured around a vulnerability taxonomy derived from OWASP. We evaluate LLMs under three configurations: prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and a hybrid of both, comparing their performance on different vulnerability categories. Experimental results show that prompt engineering achieves general robustness, while fine-tuning improves precision and recall on less semantically rich languages such as TEAL. Additionally, we analyze how the architectural differences of Solana and Algorand influence the manifestation and detectability of vulnerabilities, offering platform-specific mappings that highlight limitations in existing security tooling. Our findings suggest that LLM-based approaches are viable for static vulnerability detection in smart contracts, provided domain-specific data and categorization are integrated into training pipelines.

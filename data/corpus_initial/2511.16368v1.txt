Compute-in-memory (CIM) has emerged as a pivotal direction for accelerating workloads in the field of machine learning, such as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, the effective exploitation of sparsity in CIM systems presents numerous challenges, due to the inherent limitations in their rigid array structures. Designing sparse DNN dataflows and developing efficient mapping strategies also become more complex when accounting for diverse sparsity patterns and the flexibility of a multi-macro CIM structure. Despite these complexities, there is still an absence of a unified systematic view and modeling approach for diverse sparse DNN workloads in CIM systems. In this paper, we propose CIMinus, a framework dedicated to cost modeling for sparse DNN workloads on CIM architectures. It provides an in-depth energy consumption analysis at the level of individual components and an assessment of the overall workload latency. We validate CIMinus against contemporary CIM architectures and demonstrate its applicability in two use-cases. These cases provide valuable insights into both the impact of sparsity patterns and the effectiveness of mapping strategies, bridging the gap between theoretical design and practical implementation.

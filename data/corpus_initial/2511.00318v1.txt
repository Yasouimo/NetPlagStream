----------------------------------------
Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a flexible means to generate synthetic tabular data, yet existing approaches often fail to preserve key causal parameters such as the average treatment effect (ATE). In this technical exploration, we first demonstrate that state-of-the-art synthetic data generators, both GAN- and LLM-based, can achieve high predictive fidelity while substantially misestimating causal effects. To address this gap, we propose a hybrid generation framework that combines model-based covariate synthesis (monitored via distance-to-closest-record filtering) with separately learned propensity and outcome models, thereby ensuring that (W, A, Y) triplets retain their underlying causal structure. We further introduce a synthetic pairing strategy to mitigate positivity violations and a realistic evaluation protocol that leverages unlimited synthetic samples to benchmark traditional estimators (IPTW, AIPW, substitution) under complex covariate distributions. This work lays the groundwork for LLM-powered data pipelines that support robust causal analysis. Our code is available at https://github.com/Xyc-arch/llm-synthetic-for-causal-inference.git.

Multilabel image categorization has drawn interest recently because of its numerous computer vision applications. The proposed work introduces a novel method for classifying multilabel images using the COCO-2014 dataset and a modified ResNet-101 architecture. By simulating label dependencies and uncertainties, the approach uses probabilistic reasoning to improve prediction accuracy. Extensive tests show that the model outperforms earlier techniques and approaches to state-of-the-art outcomes in multilabel categorization. The work also thoroughly assesses the model's performance using metrics like precision-recall score and achieves 0.794 mAP on COCO-2014, outperforming ResNet-SRN (0.771) and Vision Transformer baselines (0.785). The novelty of the work lies in integrating probabilistic reasoning into deep learning models to effectively address the challenges presented by multilabel scenarios.

Electrocorticographic brain computer interfaces are powerful emergent technologies for advancing basic neuroscience research and targeted clinical interventions. However, existing devices require trade-offs between coverage area, electrode density, surgical invasiveness and complication risk: limitations that fail to meet the demands of next-generation BCI. Here, we report a guidewire-driven deployable ECoG BCI device that can be epidurally implanted using minimally invasive procedures. Our ultra-flexible but strong thin-film electrode array, which packs 256 electrodes into 4 cm2, can be folded, pulled through millimetre-sized skull holes, and unfurled seamlessly onto the brain dura mater. When deployed on the canine brain, it captures abundant high-quality auditory neural signals with distinct features of hearing that can be used to classify sound types with over 80% accuracy using various standard machine learning models. Our device is biocompatible for chronic monitoring, easy and fast to deploy and importantly, resolves the key trade-offs limiting current BCI technologies.

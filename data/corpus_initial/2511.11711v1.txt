Although sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are crucial for identifying interpretable features in neural networks, it is still challenging to distinguish between real computational patterns and erroneous correlations. We introduce Model-X knockoffs to SAE feature selection, using knock-off+ to control the false discovery rate (FDR) with finite-sample guarantees under the standard Model-X assumptions (in our case, via a Gaussian surrogate for the latent distribution). We select 129 features at a target FDR q=0.1 after analyzing 512 high-activity SAE latents for sentiment classification using Pythia-70M. About 25% of the latents under examination carry task-relevant signal, whereas 75% do not, according to the chosen set, which displays a 5.40x separation in knockoff statistics compared to non-selected features. Our method offers a re-producible and principled framework for reliable feature discovery by combining SAEs with multiple-testing-aware inference, advancing the foundations of mechanistic interpretability.

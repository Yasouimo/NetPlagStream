Artificial intelligence is accelerating a new era of food innovation, connecting data from farm to consumer to improve formulation, processing, and health outcomes. Recent advances in deep learning, natural language processing, and multi-omics integration make it possible to understand and optimize food systems with unprecedented depth. However, AI adoption across the food sector remains uneven due to heterogeneous datasets, limited model and system interoperability, and a persistent skills gap between data scientists and food domain experts. To address these challenges and advance responsible innovation, the AI Institute for Next Generation Food Systems (AIFS) convened the inaugural AI for Food Product Development Symposium at University of California, Davis, in October 2025. This white paper synthesizes insights from the symposium, organized around five domains where AI can have the greatest near-term impact: supply chain; formulation and processing; consumer insights and sensory prediction; nutrition and health; and education and workforce development. Across the areas, participants emphasized the importance of interoperable data standards, transparent and interpretable models, and cross-sector collaboration to accelerate the translation of AI research into practice. The discussions further highlighted the need for robust digital infrastructure, privacy-preserving data-sharing mechanisms, and interdisciplinary training pathways that integrate AI literacy with domain expertise. Collectively, the priorities outline a roadmap for integrating AI into food manufacturing in ways that enhance innovation, sustainability, and human well-being while ensuring that technological progress remains grounded in ethics, scientific rigor, and societal benefit.

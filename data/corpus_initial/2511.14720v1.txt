Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for modeling complex, interconnected data, making them particularly well suited for a wide range of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) applications. This survey presents the first comprehensive review dedicated specifically to the use of GNNs within Vehicular Social Networks (VSNs). By leveraging both Euclidean and non-Euclidean transportation-related data, including traffic patterns, road users, and weather conditions, GNNs offer promising solutions for analyzing and enhancing VSN applications. The survey systematically categorizes and analyzes existing studies according to major VSN-related tasks, including traffic flow and trajectory prediction, traffic forecasting, signal control, driving assistance, routing problem, and connectivity management. It further provides quantitative insights and synthesizes key takeaways derived from the literature review. Additionally, the survey examines the available datasets and outlines open research directions needed to advance GNN-based VSN applications. The findings indicate that, although GNNs demonstrate strong potential for improving the accuracy, robustness, and real-time performances of on task-specific or sub-VSN graphs, there remains a notable absence of studies that model a complete, standalone VSN encompassing all functional components. With the increasing availability of data and continued progress in graph learning, GNNs are expected to play a central role in enabling future large-scale and fully integrated VSN applications.

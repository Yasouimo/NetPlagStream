Internet of Agents (IoA) envisions a unified, agent-centric paradigm where heterogeneous large language model (LLM) agents can interconnect and collaborate at scale. Within this paradigm, federated learning (FL) serves as a key enabler that allows distributed LLM agents to co-train global models without centralizing data. However, the FL-enabled IoA system remains vulnerable to model poisoning attacks, and the prevailing distance and similarity-based defenses become fragile at billion-parameter scale and under heterogeneous data distributions. This paper proposes a graph representation-based model poisoning (GRMP) attack, which passively exploits observed benign local models to construct a parameter correlation graph and extends an adversarial variational graph autoencoder to capture and reshape higher-order dependencies. The GRMP attack synthesizes malicious local models that preserve benign-like statistics while embedding adversarial objectives, remaining elusive to detection at the server. Experiments demonstrate a gradual drop in system accuracy under the proposed attack and the ineffectiveness of the prevailing defense mechanism in detecting the attack, underscoring a severe threat to the ambitious IoA paradigm.

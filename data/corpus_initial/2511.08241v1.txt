Exploration in reinforcement learning remains a critical challenge, as naive entropy maximization often results in high variance and inefficient policy updates. We introduce \textbf{PrefPoE}, a novel \textit{Preference-Product-of-Experts} framework that performs intelligent, advantage-guided exploration via the first principled application of product-of-experts (PoE) fusion for single-task exploration-exploitation balancing. By training a preference network to concentrate probability mass on high-advantage actions and fusing it with the main policy through PoE, PrefPoE creates a \textbf{soft trust region} that stabilizes policy updates while maintaining targeted exploration. Across diverse control tasks spanning both continuous and discrete action spaces, PrefPoE demonstrates consistent improvements: +321\% on HalfCheetah-v4 (1276~$\rightarrow$~5375), +69\% on Ant-v4, +276\% on LunarLander-v2, with consistently enhanced training stability and sample efficiency. Unlike standard PPO, which suffers from entropy collapse, PrefPoE sustains adaptive exploration through its unique dynamics, thereby preventing premature convergence and enabling superior performance. Our results establish that learning \textit{where to explore} through advantage-guided preferences is as crucial as learning how to act, offering a general framework for enhancing policy gradient methods across the full spectrum of reinforcement learning domains. Code and pretrained models are available in supplementary materials.

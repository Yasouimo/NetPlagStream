----------------------------------------
Large-scale networked services rely on deep soft-ware stacks and microservice orchestration, which increase instruction footprints and create frontend stalls that inflate tail latency and energy. We revisit instruction prefetching for these cloud workloads and present a design that aligns with SLO driven and self optimizing systems. Building on the Entangling Instruction Prefetcher (EIP), we introduce a Compressed Entry that captures up to eight destinations around a base using 36 bits by exploiting spatial clustering, and a Hierarchical Metadata Storage scheme that keeps only L1 resident and frequently queried entries on chip while virtualizing bulk metadata into lower levels. We further add a lightweight Online ML Controller that scores prefetch profitability using context features and a bandit adjusted threshold. On data center applications, our approach preserves EIP like speedups with smaller on chip state and improves efficiency for networked services in the ML era.

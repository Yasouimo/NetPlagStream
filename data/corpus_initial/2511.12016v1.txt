We propose the Modified Mahalanobis Distance Conformal Prediction (MMDCP), a unified framework for multi-class classification and outlier detection under label shift, where the training and test distributions may differ. In such settings, many existing methods construct nonconformity scores based on empirical cumulative or density functions combined with data-splitting strategies. However, these approaches are often computationally expensive due to their heavy reliance on resampling procedures and tend to produce overly conservative prediction sets with unstable coverage, especially in small samples. To address these challenges, MMDCP combines class-specific distance measures with full conformal prediction to construct a score function, thereby producing adaptive prediction sets that effectively capture both inlier and outlier structures. Under mild regularity conditions, we establish convergence rates for the resulting sets and provide the first theoretical characterization of the gap between oracle and empirical conformal $p$-values, which ensures valid coverage and effective control of the class-wise false discovery rate (CW-FDR). We further introduce the Summarized Class-Wise FDR (SCW-FDR), a novel global error metric aggregating false discoveries across classes, and show that it can be effectively controlled within the MMDCP framework. Extensive simulations and two real-data applications support our theoretical findings and demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.

Next-generation (NG) wireless networks must embrace innate intelligence in support of demanding emerging applications, such as extended reality and autonomous systems, under ultra-reliable and low-latency requirements. Pinching antennas (PAs), a new flexible low-cost technology, can create line-of-sight links by dynamically activating small dielectric pinches along a waveguide on demand. As a compelling complement, artificial intelligence (AI) offers the intelligence needed to manage the complex control of PA activation positions and resource allocation in these dynamic environments. This article explores the "win-win" cooperation between AI and PAs: AI facilitates the adaptive optimization of PA activation positions along the waveguide, while PAs support edge AI tasks such as federated learning and over-the-air aggregation. We also discuss promising research directions including large language model-driven PA control frameworks, and how PA-AI integration can advance semantic communications, and integrated sensing and communication. This synergy paves the way for adaptive, resilient, and self-optimizing NG networks.

With their widespread popularity, web services have become the main targets of various cyberattacks. Existing traffic anomaly detection approaches focus on flow-level attacks, yet fail to recognize behavior-level attacks, which appear benign in individual flows but reveal malicious purpose using multiple network flows. To transcend this limitation, we propose a novel unsupervised traffic anomaly detection system, BLADE, capable of detecting not only flow-level but also behavior-level attacks in web services. Our key observation is that application-layer operations of web services exhibit distinctive communication patterns at the network layer from a multi-flow perspective. BLADE first exploits a flow autoencoder to learn a latent feature representation and calculates its reconstruction losses per flow. Then, the latent representation is assigned a pseudo operation label using an unsupervised clustering method. Next, an anomaly score is computed based on the reconstruction losses. Finally, the triplets of timestamps, pseudo labels, and anomaly scores from multiple flows are aggregated and fed into a one-class classifier to characterize the behavior patterns of legitimate web operations, enabling the detection of flow-level and behavior-level anomalies. BLADE is extensively evaluated on both the custom dataset and the CIC-IDS2017 dataset. The experimental results demonstrate BLADE's superior performance, achieving high F1 scores of 0.9732 and 0.9801, respectively, on the two datasets, and outperforming traditional single-flow anomaly detection baselines.

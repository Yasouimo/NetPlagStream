The proliferation of digital food applications necessitates robust methods for automated nutritional analysis and culinary guidance. This paper presents a comprehensive comparative evaluation of a decoupled, multimodal pipeline for food recognition. We evaluate a system integrating a specialized visual backbone (EfficientNet-B4) with a powerful generative large language model (Google's Gemini LLM). The core objective is to evaluate the trade-offs between visual classification accuracy, model efficiency, and the quality of generative output (nutritional data and recipes). We benchmark this pipeline against alternative vision backbones (VGG-16, ResNet-50, YOLOv8) and a lightweight LLM (Gemma). We introduce a formalization for "Semantic Error Propagation" (SEP) to analyze how classification inaccuracies from the visual module cascade into the generative output. Our analysis is grounded in a new Custom Chinese Food Dataset (CCFD) developed to address cultural bias in public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that while EfficientNet-B4 (89.0\% Top-1 Acc.) provides the best balance of accuracy and efficiency, and Gemini (9.2/10 Factual Accuracy) provides superior generative quality, the system's overall utility is fundamentally bottlenecked by the visual front-end's perceptive accuracy. We conduct a detailed per-class analysis, identifying high semantic similarity as the most critical failure mode.

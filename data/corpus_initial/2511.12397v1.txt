This work addresses a key challenge in inventory management by developing a stochastic model that describes the dynamic distribution of inventory stock over time without assuming a specific demand distribution. Our model provides a flexible and applicable solution for situations with limited historical data and short-term predictions, making it well-suited for the Newsvendor problem. We evaluate our model's performance using real-world data from a large electronic marketplace, demonstrating its effectiveness in a practical forecasting scenario.

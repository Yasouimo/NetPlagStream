We describe the design concept and estimated performance of an iron-scintillator sampling calorimeter for the future Electron Ion Collider. The novel aspect of this detector is a multi-dimensional readout coupled with foreseen excellent time resolution, enabling time-of-flight capabilities as well as a more compact overall assembly. Machine Learning is used to optimize the detector design, and the highly segmented readout is implemented with Machine Learning algorithms in mind to reach performance levels usually reserved for more complex detector systems. The primary physics objective is to serve as a muon detector/ID system at the EIC as well as provide for the identification and momentum measurement of neutral hadrons. At the EIC, these are mainly $K_L$'s and neutrons: for lower energies, excellent relative momentum measurements of a few 10\% are achieved using time-of-flight, while for higher particle momenta, the energy can be measured calorimetrically with a resolution significantly better than has been demonstrated for similar calorimeters that are read out with less granularity.

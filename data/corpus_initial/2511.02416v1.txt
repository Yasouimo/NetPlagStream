The Earth's mantle transition zone (MTZ) is widely recognized as a major water reservoir, exerting significant influence on the planet's water budget and deep cycling processes. Here, we employ crystal structure prediction and first-principles calculations to identify a series of stable hydrous magnesium silicate phases under transition zone conditions. Our results reveal a pressure-induced hydrogen substitution mechanism in wadsleyite, where H+ preferentially migrates from Mg2+ sites to Si4+ sites near 410 km depth. This transformation leads to a substantial decrease in electrical conductivity, consistent with geophysical observations. We estimate the water content in the MTZ to be approximately 1.6 wt%, aligning with seismic and conductivity constraints. Furthermore, using machine learning-enhanced molecular dynamics, we discover double superionicity in hydrous wadsleyite and ringwoodite at temperatures exceeding 2000 K, wherein both H+ and Mg2+ exhibit high ionic mobility. This dual-ion superionic state has potentially profound implications for mass transport, electrical conductivity, and magnetic dynamo generation in rocky super-Earth exoplanets.

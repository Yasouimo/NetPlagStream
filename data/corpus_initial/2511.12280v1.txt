----------------------------------------
Diffusion-based multimodal large language models (Diffusion MLLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive non-autoregressive generative capabilities across vision-and-language tasks. However, Diffusion MLLMs exhibit substantially slower inference than autoregressive models: Each denoising step employs full bidirectional self-attention over the entire sequence, resulting in cubic decoding complexity that becomes computationally impractical with thousands of visual tokens. To address this challenge, we propose D$^{3}$ToM, a Decider-guided dynamic token merging method that dynamically merges redundant visual tokens at different denoising steps to accelerate inference in Diffusion MLLMs. At each denoising step, D$^{3}$ToM uses decider tokens-the tokens generated in the previous denoising step-to build an importance map over all visual tokens. Then it maintains a proportion of the most salient tokens and merges the remainder through similarity-based aggregation. This plug-and-play module integrates into a single transformer layer, physically shortening the visual token sequence for all subsequent layers without altering model parameters. Moreover, D$^{3}$ToM employs a merge ratio that dynamically varies with each denoising step, aligns with the native decoding process of Diffusion MLLMs, achieving superior performance under equivalent computational budgets. Extensive experiments show that D$^{3}$ToM accelerates inference while preserving competitive performance. The code is released at https://github.com/bcmi/D3ToM-Diffusion-MLLM.

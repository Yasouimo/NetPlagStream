Speech-to-Speech (S2S) models have shown promising dialogue capabilities, but their ability to handle paralinguistic cues--such as emotion, tone, and speaker attributes--and to respond appropriately in both content and style remains underexplored. Progress is further hindered by the scarcity of high-quality and expressive demonstrations. To address this, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework for paralinguistic-aware S2S, ParaS2S, which evaluates and optimizes both content and speaking style directly at the waveform level. We first construct ParaS2SBench, a benchmark comprehensively evaluates S2S models' output for content and style appropriateness from diverse and challenging input queries. It scores the fitness of input-output pairs and aligns well with human judgments, serving as an automatic judge for model outputs. With this scalable scoring feedback, we enable the model to explore and learn from diverse unlabeled speech via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments show that existing S2S models fail to respond appropriately to paralinguistic attributes, performing no better than pipeline-based baselines. Our RL approach achieves a 11% relative improvement in response content and style's appropriateness on ParaS2SBench over supervised fine-tuning (SFT), surpassing all prior models while requiring substantially fewer warm-up annotations than pure SFT.

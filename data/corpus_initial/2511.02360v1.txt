In human cognition, there exist numerous thought processes that are tacit and beyond verbal expression, enabling us to understand and interact with the world in multiple ways. However, contemporary Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain constrained to reasoning within the discrete and rigid space of linguistic tokens, thereby bottlenecking the rich, high-dimensional nature of visual perception. To bridge this gap, we propose CoCoVa (Chain of Continuous Vision-Language Thought), a novel framework for vision-language model that leverages continuous cross-modal reasoning for diverse vision-language tasks. The core of CoCoVa is an iterative reasoning cycle, where a novel Latent Q-Former (LQ-Former) acts as a dynamic reasoning engine, iteratively refining a chain of latent thought vectors through cross-modal fusion. To focus this process, a token selection mechanism dynamically identifies salient visual regions, mimicking attentional focus. To ensure these latent thoughts remain grounded, we train the model with a multi-task objective that combines contrastive learning and diffusion-based reconstruction, enforcing alignment between latent representations and both visual and textual modalities. Evaluations show CoCoVa improves accuracy and token efficiency over strong baselines. With a 1.5B backbone, it competes with or surpasses larger 7B-9B models on almost all benchmarks. When scaled to 7B LLM backbones, it remains competitive with state-of-the-art models. Qualitative analysis validates that learned latent space captures interpretable and structured reasoning patterns, highlighting the potential of CoCoVa to bridge the representational gap between discrete language processing and the continuous nature of visual understanding.

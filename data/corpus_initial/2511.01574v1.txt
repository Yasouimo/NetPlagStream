Compared to traditional methods, Deep Learning (DL) becomes a key technology for computer vision tasks. Synthetic data generation is an interesting use case for DL, especially in the field of medical imaging such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The need for this task since the original MRI data is limited. The generation of realistic medical images is completely difficult and challenging. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are useful for creating synthetic medical images. In this paper, we propose a DL based methodology for creating synthetic MRI data using the Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DC-GAN) to address the problem of limited data. We also employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier to classify the brain tumor using synthetic data and real MRI data. CNN is used to evaluate the quality and utility of the synthetic images. The classification result demonstrates comparable performance on real and synthetic images, which validates the effectiveness of GAN-generated images for downstream tasks.

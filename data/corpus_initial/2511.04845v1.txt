This paper utilizes a machine learning model to estimate the consumer's behavior for food products with innovative transportation certificates in the U.S. Building on previous research that examined demand for food products with supply chain traceability using stated preference analysis, transportation factors were identified as significant in consumer food purchasing choices. Consequently, a second experiment was conducted to pinpoint the specific transportation attributes valued by consumers. A machine learning model was applied, and five innovative certificates related to transportation were proposed: Transportation Mode, Internet of Things (IoT), Safety measures, Energy Source, and Must Arrive By Dates (MABDs). The preference experiment also incorporated product-specific and decision-maker factors for control purposes. The findings reveal a notable inclination toward safety and energy certificates within the transportation domain of the U.S. food supply chain. Additionally, the study examined the influence of price, product type, certificates, and decision-maker factors on purchasing choices. Ultimately, the study offers data-driven recommendations for improving food supply chain systems.

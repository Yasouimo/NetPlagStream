----------------------------------------
Pretrained VLMs exhibit strong zero-shot classification capabilities, but their predictions degrade significantly under common image corruptions. To improve robustness, many test-time adaptation (TTA) methods adopt positive data augmentation (PDA), which generates multiple views of each test sample to reduce prediction variance. However, these methods suffer from two key limitations. First, it introduces considerable computational overhead due to the large number of augmentations required per image. Second, it fails to mitigate prediction bias, where the model tends to predict certain classes disproportionately under corruption, as PDA operates on corrupted inputs and typically does not remove the corruption itself. To address these challenges, we propose Panda, a novel TTA method based on negative data augmentation (NDA). Unlike positive augmentations that preserve object semantics, Panda generates negative augmentations by disrupting semantic content. It divides images into patches and randomly assembles them from a shared patch pool. These negatively augmented images retain corruption-specific features while discarding object-relevant signals. We then subtract the mean feature of these negative samples from the original image feature, effectively suppressing corruption-related components while preserving class-relevant information. This mitigates prediction bias under distribution shifts. Panda allows augmentation to be shared across samples within a batch, resulting in minimal computational overhead. Panda can be seamlessly integrated into existing test-time adaptation frameworks and substantially improve their robustness. Our experiments indicate that Panda delivers superior performance compared to PDA methods, and a wide range of TTA methods exhibit significantly enhanced performance when integrated with Panda.

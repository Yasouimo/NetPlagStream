Complex electromagnetic environments, often containing multiple jammers with different jamming patterns, produce non-uniform jamming power across the frequency spectrum. This spectral non-uniformity directly induces severe distortion in the target's HRRP, consequently compromising the performance and reliability of conventional HRRP-based target recognition methods. This paper proposes a novel, end-to-end trained network for robust radar target recognition. The core of our model is a CFA module that operates directly on the complex spectrum of the received echo. The CFA module learns to generate an adaptive frequency-domain filter, assigning lower weights to bands corrupted by strong jamming while preserving critical target information in cleaner bands. The filtered spectrum is then fed into a classifier backbone for recognition. Experimental results on simulated HRRP data with various jamming combinations demonstrate our method's superiority. Notably, under severe jamming conditions, our model achieves a recognition accuracy nearly 9% higher than traditional model-based approaches, all while introducing negligible computational overhead. This highlights its exceptional performance and robustness in challenging jamming environments.

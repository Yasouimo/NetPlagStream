Phase-field (PF) simulation provides a powerful framework for predicting microstructural evolution but suffers from prohibitive computational costs that severely limit accessible spatiotemporal scales in practical applications. While data-driven methods have emerged as promising approaches for accelerating PF simulations, existing methods require extensive training data from numerous evolution trajectories, and their inherent black-box nature raises concerns about long-term prediction reliability. This work demonstrates, through examples of grain growth and spinodal decomposition, that a minimalist Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained with a remarkably small dataset even from a single small-scale simulation can achieve seamless scalability to larger systems and reliable long-term predictions far beyond the temporal range of the training data. The key insight of this work lies in revealing that the success of CNN-based models stems from the alignment between their inductive biases and the physical priors of phase-field simulations specifically, locality and spatiotemporal translation invariance. Through effective receptive field analysis, we verify that the model captures these essential properties during training. Therefore, from a reductionist perspective, the surrogate model essentially establishes a spatiotemporally invariant regression mapping between a grid point's local environment and its subsequent state. Further analysis of the model's feature space demonstrates that microstructural evolution effectively represents a continuous redistribution of a finite set of local environments. When the model has already encountered nearly all possible local environments in the early-stage training data, it can reliably generalize to much longer evolution timescales, regardless of the dramatic changes in global microstructural morphology.

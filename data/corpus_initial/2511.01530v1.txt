Volcanic regions have shaped human settlements for millennia, placing over 500 million people worldwide within close proximity to active volcanoes. Predicting eruptions that threaten both lives and property remains a critical challenge, given the complexity and diversity of seismic signals and recording formats. Effective early warning systems require tools that are not only powerful but also user-friendly, computationally efficient, and capable of handling large seismic datasets and complex mathematical and probabilistic models used in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. We present a Shannon Entropy Estimator for the Characterization of Seismic-Volcanic Signals using Python designed to meet these demands. Featuring intuitive graphical user interfaces and a low learning curve, the system enables real-time analysis of seismic data using four key metrics: Shannon Entropy, Kurtosis, Frequency Index, and Energy. These metrics provide robust insights into a volcanoes state across different stages, independently of the type of event (VT, VLP, Tremor, Hybrid, Explosions) or the data format (SAC, MSEED, SEISAN, etc.). In this work, the efficacy of this tool is demonstrated through the analysis and graphical presentation of these metrics using real seismic records from active volcanoes, providing concrete examples of its practical application. This approach allows reliable monitoring, accurate categorization, and early detection of critical changes in volcanic activity, supporting the development of predictive models and enhancing the effectiveness of early warning systems. This practical, low-cost solution meets the analytical needs of research institutes and observatories while contributing to the mitigation of volcanic hazards worldwide.

This paper proposes a smart way to manage municipal solid waste by using the Internet of Things (IoT) and computer vision (CV) to monitor illegal waste dumping at garbage vulnerable points (GVPs) in urban areas. The system can quickly detect and monitor dumped waste using a street-level camera and object detection algorithm. Data was collected from the Sangareddy district in Telangana, India. A series of comprehensive experiments was carried out using the proposed dataset to assess the accuracy and overall performance of various object detection models. Specifically, we performed an in-depth evaluation of YOLOv8, YOLOv10, YOLO11m, and RT-DETR on our dataset. Among these models, YOLO11m achieved the highest accuracy of 92.39\% in waste detection, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting waste. Additionally, it attains an mAP@50 of 0.91, highlighting its high precision. These findings confirm that the object detection model is well-suited for monitoring and tracking waste dumping events at GVP locations. Furthermore, the system effectively captures waste disposal patterns, including hourly, daily, and weekly dumping trends, ensuring comprehensive daily and nightly monitoring.

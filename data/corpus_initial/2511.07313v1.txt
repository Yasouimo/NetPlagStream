Functional connectivity has been widely investigated to understand brain disease in clinical studies and imaging-based neuroscience, and analyzing changes in functional connectivity has proven to be valuable for understanding and computationally evaluating the effects on brain function caused by diseases or experimental stimuli. By using Mahalanobis data whitening prior to the use of dimensionality reduction algorithms, we are able to distill meaningful information from fMRI signals about subjects and the experimental stimuli used to prompt them. Furthermore, we offer an interpretation of Mahalanobis whitening as a two-stage de-individualization of data which is motivated by similarity as captured by the Bures distance, which is connected to quantum mechanics. These methods have potential to aid discoveries about the mechanisms that link brain function with cognition and behavior and may improve the accuracy and consistency of Alzheimer's diagnosis, especially in the preclinical stage of disease progression.

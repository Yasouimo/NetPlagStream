The personalization of black-box large language models (LLMs) is a critical yet challenging task. Existing approaches predominantly rely on context injection, where user history is embedded into the prompt to directly guide the generation process. However, this single-step paradigm imposes a dual burden on the model: generating accurate content while simultaneously aligning with user-specific styles. This often results in a trade-off that compromises output quality and limits precise control. To address this fundamental tension, we propose Reflective Personalization Optimization (RPO), a novel framework that redefines the personalization paradigm by decoupling content generation from alignment. RPO operates in two distinct stages: first, a base model generates a high-quality, generic response; then, an external reflection module explicitly rewrites this output to align with the user's preferences. This reflection module is trained using a two-stage process. Initially, supervised fine-tuning is employed on structured rewriting trajectories to establish a core personalized reasoning policy that models the transformation from generic to user-aligned responses. Subsequently, reinforcement learning is applied to further refine and enhance the quality of the personalized outputs. Comprehensive experiments on the LaMP benchmark demonstrate that RPO, by decoupling content generation from personalization, significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. These findings underscore the superiority of explicit response shaping over implicit context injection. Moreover, RPO introduces an efficient, model-agnostic personalization layer that can be seamlessly integrated with any underlying base model, paving the way for a new and effective direction in user-centric generation scenarios.

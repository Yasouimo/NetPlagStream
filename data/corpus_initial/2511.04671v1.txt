Human videos can be recorded quickly and at scale, making them an appealing source of training data for robot learning. However, humans and robots differ fundamentally in embodiment, resulting in mismatched action execution. Direct kinematic retargeting of human hand motion can therefore produce actions that are physically infeasible for robots. Despite these low-level differences, human demonstrations provide valuable motion cues about how to manipulate and interact with objects. Our key idea is to exploit the forward diffusion process: as noise is added to actions, low-level execution differences fade while high-level task guidance is preserved. We present X-Diffusion, a principled framework for training diffusion policies that maximally leverages human data without learning dynamically infeasible motions. X-Diffusion first trains a classifier to predict whether a noisy action is executed by a human or robot. Then, a human action is incorporated into policy training only after adding sufficient noise such that the classifier cannot discern its embodiment. Actions consistent with robot execution supervise fine-grained denoising at low noise levels, while mismatched human actions provide only coarse guidance at higher noise levels. Our experiments show that naive co-training under execution mismatches degrades policy performance, while X-Diffusion consistently improves it. Across five manipulation tasks, X-Diffusion achieves a 16% higher average success rate than the best baseline. The project website is available at https://portal-cornell.github.io/X-Diffusion/.

Optimal transport (OT) and its entropy-regularized form (EOT) have become increasingly prominent computational problems, with applications in machine learning and statistics. Recent years have seen a commensurate surge in first-order methods aiming to improve the complexity of large-scale (E)OT. However, there has been a consistent tradeoff: attaining state-of-the-art rates requires $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ storage to enable ergodic primal averaging. In this work, we demonstrate that recently proposed primal-dual extragradient methods (PDXG) can be implemented entirely in the dual with $\mathcal{O}(n)$ storage. Additionally, we prove that regularizing the reformulated OT problem is equivalent to EOT with extensions to entropy-regularized barycenter problems, further widening the applications of the proposed method. The proposed dual-only extragradient method (DXG) achieves $\mathcal{O}(n^2\varepsilon^{-1})$ complexity for $\varepsilon$-approximate OT with $\mathcal{O}(n)$ memory. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the dual extragradient method scales favorably in non/weakly-regularized regimes compared to existing algorithms, though future work is needed to improve performance in certain problem classes.

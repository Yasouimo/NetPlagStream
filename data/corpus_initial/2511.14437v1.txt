The steadily increasing level of automation in human-centred systems demands rigorous design methods for analysing and controlling interactions between humans and automated components, especially in safety-critical applications. The variability of human behaviour poses particular challenges for formal verification and synthesis. We present a model-based framework that enables design-time exploration of safe shared-control strategies in human-automation systems. The approach combines active automata learning -- to derive coarse, finite-state abstractions of human behaviour from simulations -- with game-theoretic reactive synthesis to determine whether a controller can guarantee safety when interacting with these models. If no such strategy exists, the framework supports iterative refinement of the human model or adjustment of the automation's controllable actions. A driving case study, integrating automata learning with reactive synthesis in UPPAAL, illustrates the applicability of the framework on a simplified driving scenario and its potential for analysing shared-control strategies in human-centred cyber-physical systems.

We present a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework for reconstructing the redshift-dependent Hubble parameter \(H(z)\) within the Tsallis Holographic Dark Energy (THDE) model extended by massive neutrinos. In this approach, the modified Friedmann equation is incorporated into the neural network loss function, enabling training on Cosmic Chronometers data up to \(z \leq 2\). The framework allows for the simultaneous estimation of the Hubble constant \(H_0\), the neutrino density parameter \(Ω_ν\), and the Tsallis non-extensivity index \(δ\). Uncertainty quantification is performed through dropout simulations, resulting in statistically consistent \(1σ\) confidence bands. Our results show that the THDE+$ν$ model, reconstructed via PINN, alleviates the statistical Hubble tension from the canonical \(\sim 5σ\) level down to a range of \(0.5σ\leq T \leq 2.2σ\), depending on the redshift sampling. Additionally, we constrain the total neutrino mass to \(Σm_ν< 0.11\,\text{eV}\). A detailed comparison with the traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis demonstrates the consistency of both methods, while highlighting the competitiveness of the PINN-based THDE framework as a robust, data-driven approach for non-parametric cosmological inference within generalized thermodynamics.

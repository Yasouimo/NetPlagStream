The compounding of plastics with recycled material remains a practical challenge, as the properties of the processed material is not as easy to control as with completely new raw materials. For a data scientist, it makes sense to plan the necessary experiments in the development of new compounds using Bayesian Optimization, an optimization approach based on a surrogate model that is known for its data efficiency and is therefore well suited for data obtained from costly experiments. Furthermore, if historical data and expert knowledge are available, their inclusion in the surrogate model is expected to accelerate the convergence of the optimization. In this article, we describe a use case in which the addition of data and knowledge has impaired optimization. We also describe the unsuccessful methods that were used to remedy the problem before we found the reasons for the poor performance and achieved a satisfactory result. We conclude with a lesson learned: additional knowledge and data are only beneficial if they do not complicate the underlying optimization goal.

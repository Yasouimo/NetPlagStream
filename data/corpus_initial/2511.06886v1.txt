Most of the Natural Language Processing systems are involved in entity-based processing for several tasks like Information Extraction, Question-Answering, Text-Summarization and so on. A new challenge comes when entities play roles according to their act or attributes in certain context. Entity Role Detection is the task of assigning such roles to the entities. Usually real-world entities are of types: person, location and organization etc. Roles could be considered as domain-dependent subtypes of these types. In the cases, where retrieving a subset of entities based on their roles is needed, poses the problem of defining the role and entities having those roles. This paper presents the study of study of solving Entity Role Detection problem by modeling it as Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Entity Retrieval/Ranking task. In NER, these roles could be considered as mutually exclusive classes and standard NER methods like sequence tagging could be used. For Entity Retrieval, Roles could be formulated as Query and entities as Collection on which the query needs to be executed. The aspect of Entity Retrieval task, which is different than document retrieval task is that the entities and roles against which they need to be retrieved are indirectly described. We have formulated automated ways of learning representative words and phrases and building representations of roles and entities using them. We have also explored different contexts like sentence and document. Since the roles depend upon context, so it is not always possible to have large domain-specific dataset or knowledge bases for learning purposes, so we have tried to exploit the information from small dataset in domain-agnostic way.

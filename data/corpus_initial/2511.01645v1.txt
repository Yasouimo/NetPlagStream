Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently been incorporated into diffusion models, e.g., tasks such as text-to-image. However, directly applying existing RL methods to diffusion-based image restoration models is suboptimal, as the objective of restoration fundamentally differs from that of pure generation: it places greater emphasis on fidelity. In this paper, we investigate how to effectively integrate RL into diffusion-based restoration models. First, through extensive experiments with various reward functions, we find that an effective reward can be derived from an Image Quality Assessment (IQA) model, instead of intuitive ground-truth-based supervision, which has already been optimized during the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) stage prior to RL. Moreover, our strategy focuses on using RL for challenging samples that are significantly distant from the ground truth, and our RL approach is innovatively implemented using MLLM-based IQA models to align distributions with high-quality images initially. As the samples approach the ground truth's distribution, RL is adaptively combined with SFT for more fine-grained alignment. This dynamic process is facilitated through an automatic weighting strategy that adjusts based on the relative difficulty of the training samples. Our strategy is plug-and-play that can be seamlessly applied to diffusion-based restoration models, boosting its performance across various restoration tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed RL framework.

The automation of material handling in warehouses increasingly relies on robust, low cost perception systems for forklifts and Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs). This work presents a vision based framework for pallet and pallet hole detection and mapping using a single standard camera. We utilized YOLOv8 and YOLOv11 architectures, enhanced through Optuna driven hyperparameter optimization and spatial post processing. An innovative pallet hole mapping module converts the detections into actionable spatial representations, enabling accurate pallet and pallet hole association for forklift operation. Experiments on a custom dataset augmented with real warehouse imagery show that YOLOv8 achieves high pallet and pallet hole detection accuracy, while YOLOv11, particularly under optimized configurations, offers superior precision and stable convergence. The results demonstrate the feasibility of a cost effective, retrofittable visual perception module for forklifts. This study proposes a scalable approach to advancing warehouse automation, promoting safer, economical, and intelligent logistics operations.

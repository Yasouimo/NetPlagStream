Vision-Language Models (VLMs) suffer from catastrophic forgetting when sequentially fine-tuned on new tasks, degrading performance on previously learned foundational and task-specific capabilities. While multi-task learning can mitigate forgetting, it requires simultaneous access to all datasets and imposes computational overhead that scales linearly with the number of tasks. In this work, we introduce a routing-based approach that enables the integration of new tasks while preserving the foundational knowledge acquired during pretraining. We evaluate our method using InternVL-2 models (2B and 8B parameters) and demonstrate that routing preserves the model's foundational capabilities by maintaining performance on general-purpose benchmarks such as ChartQA, MMBench, and DocVQA, while simultaneously improving accuracy on specialized tasks. Importantly, our approach achieves this without requiring concurrent access to data from all tasks, avoiding the significant computational and data overhead associated with traditional multi-task learning. We further conduct extensive ablation studies to evaluate the scalability and robustness of routing-based learning, showing that the approach is resilient to a growing number of tasks and performs particularly well when new tasks are semantically related. Finally, we show that the routing mechanism enables superior cross-modal transfer between language and vision capabilities, allowing knowledge learned in one modality to enhance performance in another capability not achieved by existing continual learning methods.

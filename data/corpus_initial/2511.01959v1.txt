Pulsar Timing Arrays provide a powerful framework to measure low-frequency gravitational waves, but accuracy and robustness of the results are challenged by complex noise processes that must be accurately modeled. Standard PTA analyses assign fixed uniform noise priors to each pulsar, an approach that can introduce systematic biases when combining the array. To overcome this limitation, we adopt a hierarchical Bayesian modeling strategy in which noise priors are parametrized by higher-level hyperparameters. We further address the challenge posed by the correlations between hyperparameters and physical noise parameters, focusing on those describing red noise and dispersion measure variations. To decorrelate these quantities, we introduce an orthogonal reparametrization of the hierarchical model implemented with Normalizing Flows. We also employ i-nessai, a flow-guided nested sampler, to efficiently explore the resulting higher-dimensional parameter space. We apply our method to a minimal 3-pulsar case study, performing a simultaneous inference of noise and SGWB parameters. Despite the limited dataset, the results consistently show that the hierarchical treatment constrains the noise parameters more tightly and partially alleviates the red-noise-SGWB degeneracy, while the orthogonal reparametrization further enhances parameter independence without affecting the correlations intrinsic to the power-law modeling of the physical processes involved.

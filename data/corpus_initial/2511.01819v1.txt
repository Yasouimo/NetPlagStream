Ultra-wideband (UWB) localization delivers centimeter-scale accuracy but is vulnerable to jamming attacks, creating security risks for asset tracking and intrusion detection in smart buildings. Although machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods have improved tag localization, localizing malicious jammers within a single room and across changing indoor layouts remains largely unexplored. Two novel UWB datasets, collected under original and modified room configurations, are introduced to establish comprehensive ML/DL baselines. Performance is rigorously evaluated using a variety of classification and regression metrics. On the source dataset with the collected UWB features, Random Forest achieves the highest F1-macro score of 0.95 and XGBoost achieves the lowest mean Euclidean error of 20.16 cm. However, deploying these source-trained models in the modified room layout led to severe performance degradation, with XGBoost's mean Euclidean error increasing tenfold to 207.99 cm, demonstrating significant domain shift. To mitigate this degradation, a domain-adversarial ConvNeXt autoencoder (A-CNT) is proposed that leverages a gradient-reversal layer to align CIR-derived features across domains. The A-CNT framework restores localization performance by reducing the mean Euclidean error to 34.67 cm. This represents a 77 percent improvement over non-adversarial transfer learning and an 83 percent improvement over the best baseline, restoring the fraction of samples within 30 cm to 0.56. Overall, the results demonstrate that adversarial feature alignment enables robust and transferable indoor jammer localization despite environmental changes.

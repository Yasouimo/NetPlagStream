Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) are emerging as powerful tools for learning generalizable visuomotor control policies. However, current VLAs are mostly trained on large-scale image-text-action data and remain limited in two key ways: (i) they struggle with pixel-level scene understanding, and (ii) they rely heavily on textual prompts, which reduces their flexibility in real-world settings. To address these challenges, we introduce PixelVLA, the first VLA model designed to support both pixel-level reasoning and multimodal prompting with text and visual inputs. Our approach is built on a new visuomotor instruction tuning framework that integrates a multiscale pixel-aware encoder with a visual prompting encoder. To train PixelVLA effectively, we further propose a two-stage automated annotation pipeline that generates Pixel-160K, a large-scale dataset with pixel-level annotations derived from existing robot data. Experiments on three standard VLA benchmarks and two VLA model variants show that PixelVLA improves manipulation success rates by 10.1%-17.8% over OpenVLA, while requiring only 1.5% of its pretraining cost. These results demonstrate that PixelVLA can be integrated into existing VLAs to enable more accurate, efficient, and versatile robot control in complex environments. The dataset and code will be released as open source.

During laparoscopic surgery, smoke generated by tissue cauterization can significantly degrade the visual quality of endoscopic frames, increasing the risk of surgical errors and hindering both clinical decision-making and computer-assisted visual analysis. Consequently, removing surgical smoke is critical to ensuring patient safety and maintaining operative efficiency. In this study, we propose the Surgical Atmospheric Model (SurgiATM) for surgical smoke removal. SurgiATM statistically bridges a physics-based atmospheric model and data-driven deep learning models, combining the superior generalizability of the former with the high accuracy of the latter. Furthermore, SurgiATM is designed as a lightweight, plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated into diverse surgical desmoking architectures to enhance their accuracy and stability, better meeting clinical requirements. It introduces only two hyperparameters and no additional trainable weights, preserving the original network architecture with minimal computational and modification overhead. We conduct extensive experiments on three public surgical datasets with ten desmoking methods, involving multiple network architectures and covering diverse procedures, including cholecystectomy, partial nephrectomy, and diaphragm dissection. The results demonstrate that incorporating SurgiATM commonly reduces the restoration errors of existing models and relatively enhances their generalizability, without adding any trainable layers or weights. This highlights the convenience, low cost, effectiveness, and generalizability of the proposed method. The code for SurgiATM is released at https://github.com/MingyuShengSMY/SurgiATM.

Conventional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems are challenged by variant invoice layouts, handwritten text, and low- quality scans, which are often caused by strong template dependencies that restrict their flexibility across different document structures and layouts. Newer solutions utilize advanced deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) as well as Transformers, and domain-specific models for better layout analysis and accuracy across various sections over varied document types. Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized extraction pipelines at their core with sophisticated entity recognition and semantic comprehension to support complex contextual relationship mapping without direct programming specification. Visual Named Entity Recognition (NER) capabilities permit extraction from invoice images with greater contextual sensitivity and much higher accuracy rates than older approaches. Existing industry best practices utilize hybrid architectures that blend OCR technology and LLM for maximum scalability and minimal human intervention. This work introduces a holistic Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform combining OCR, deep learning, LLMs, and graph analytics to achieve unprecedented extraction quality and consistency.

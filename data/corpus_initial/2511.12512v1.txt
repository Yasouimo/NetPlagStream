Physics-informed learning for PDEs is surging across scientific computing and industrial simulation, yet prevailing methods face spectral bias, residual-data imbalance, and weak extrapolation. We introduce a representation-level spectral remodeling xLSTM-PINN that combines gated-memory multiscale feature extraction with adaptive residual-data weighting to curb spectral bias and strengthen extrapolation. Across four benchmarks, we integrate gated cross-scale memory, a staged frequency curriculum, and adaptive residual reweighting, and verify with analytic references and extrapolation tests, achieving markedly lower spectral error and RMSE and a broader stable learning-rate window. Frequency-domain benchmarks show raised high-frequency kernel weights and a right-shifted resolvable bandwidth, shorter high-k error decay and time-to-threshold, and narrower error bands with lower MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MaxAE. Compared with the baseline PINN, we reduce MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MaxAE across all four benchmarks and deliver cleaner boundary transitions with attenuated high-frequency ripples in both frequency and field maps. This work suppresses spectral bias, widens the resolvable band and shortens the high-k time-to-threshold under the same budget, and without altering AD or physics losses improves accuracy, reproducibility, and transferability.

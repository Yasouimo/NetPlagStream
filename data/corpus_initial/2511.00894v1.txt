This study examines machine learning techniques like Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, and ensemble methods to detect Android malware. The study evaluates these models on a dataset of Android applications and analyzes their accuracy, efficiency, and real-world applicability. Key findings show that ensemble methods demonstrate superior performance, but there are trade-offs between model interpretability, efficiency, and accuracy. Given its increasing threat, the insights guide future research and practical use of ML to combat Android malware.

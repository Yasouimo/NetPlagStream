We provide counterexamples showing that uniform laws of large numbers do not hold for subdifferentials under natural assumptions. Our results apply to random Lipschitz functions and random convex functions with a finite number of smooth pieces. Consequently, they resolve the questions posed by Shapiro and Xu [J. Math. Anal. Appl., 325(2), 2007] in the negative and highlight the obstacles nonsmoothness poses to uniform results.

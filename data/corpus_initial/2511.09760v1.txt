Constructing realistic digital twins for applications such as training autonomous driving models requires the efficient allocation of real-world data, yet data sovereignty regulations present a major challenge. To address this, we tackle the optimization problem faced by metaverse service providers (MSPs) responsible for allocating geographically constrained data resources. We propose a two-stage stochastic integer programming (SIP) model that incorporates reservation and on-demand planning, enabling MSPs to efficiently subscribe and allocate data from specific regions to clients for training their models on local road conditions. The SIP model is transformed into a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation and implemented for the first time at a practical scale on a 550-qubit coherent Ising machine (CIM), representing an exploratory step toward future quantum computing paradigms. Our approach introduces an MSP-centric framework for compliant data collection under sovereignty constraints, a hybrid cost model combining deterministic fees with probabilistic penalties, and a practical implementation on quantum hardware. Experimental results demonstrate that CIM-based optimization finds high-quality solutions with millisecond-scale ($10^3$ second) computation times, significantly outperforming quantum-inspired solvers like PyQUBO. Although classical solvers such as Gurobi can achieve marginally better solution quality, CIM is orders of magnitude faster, establishing a practical paradigm for quantum-enhanced resource management.

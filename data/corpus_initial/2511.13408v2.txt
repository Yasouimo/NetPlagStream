Quantum algorithms based on parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) have enabled a wide range of applications on near-term quantum devices. However, existing PQC architectures face several challenges, among which the ``barren plateaus" phenomenon is particularly prominent. In such cases, the loss function concentrates exponentially with increasing system size, thereby hindering effective parameter optimization. To address this challenge, we propose a general and hardware-efficient method for eliminating barren plateaus in an arbitrary PQC. Specifically, our approach achieves this by inserting a layer of easily implementable quantum channels into the original PQC, each channel requiring only one ancilla qubit and four additional gates, yielding a modified PQC (MPQC) that is provably at least as expressive as the original PQC and, under mild assumptions, is guaranteed to be free from barren plateaus. Furthermore, by appropriately adjusting the structure of MPQCs, we rigorously prove that any parameter in the original PQC can be made trainable. Importantly, the absence of barren plateaus in MPQCs is robust against realistic noise, making our approach directly applicable to current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Numerically, we demonstrate the practicality of our method by modifying a commonly used PQC for thermal-state preparation. The results show that {barren plateaus are effectively eliminated} in this class of circuits with up to 100 qubits and 2400 layers, whereas the original ansatz suffers from severe gradient vanishing.

Early detection of oral cancer and potentially malignant disorders is challenging in low-resource settings due to limited annotated data. We present a unified four-class oral lesion classifier that integrates deep RGB embeddings, hyperspectral reconstruction, handcrafted spectral-textural descriptors, and demographic metadata. A pathologist-verified subset of oral cavity images was curated and processed using a fine-tuned ConvNeXt-v2 encoder, followed by RGB-to-HSI reconstruction into 31-band hyperspectral cubes. Haemoglobin-sensitive indices, texture features, and spectral-shape measures were extracted and fused with deep and clinical features. Multiple machine-learning models were assessed with patient-wise validation. We further introduce an incremental heuristic meta-learner (IHML) that combines calibrated base classifiers through probabilistic stacking and patient-level posterior smoothing. On an unseen patient split, the proposed framework achieved a macro F1 of 66.23% and an accuracy of 64.56%. Results demonstrate that hyperspectral reconstruction and uncertainty-aware meta-learning substantially improve robustness for real-world oral lesion screening.

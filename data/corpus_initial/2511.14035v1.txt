Using data on 103 recent P4 college football hires, we built a statistical model for predicting a coach's success at their new school. For each hire, we collected data about their background and experiences, the previous success as a head coach or coordinator and their success since hiring. Over 50 variables on these factors were recorded though we used 29 of these in building our predictive model. Our measure of success is based upon Bill Connelly's SP+ team ratings relative to the performance on the same metric of the school in the 15 year prior to their selection as head coach. Using a cross-validated regularized linear regression, we obtain a predictive model for coaching success. Among the important factors for predicting a successful hire are having been a previous college head coach, having won a prior conference championship as a head coach, leaving a job as an Offensive Coordinator, age and quality of the hiring school's team in the previous 15 years. While we do find these factors are important for the prediction of a successful coaching hire, the trends here are weak. With 66% accuracy, the model does identify coaching hires that will outperform team performance in the 15 years before the hire. However, no combination of these factors leads to high predictability of identifying a successful coaching hire. All of the data and code for this paper are available in a Github repository.

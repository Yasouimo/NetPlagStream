This chapter addresses the critical challenge of simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) transfer for deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in bipedal locomotion. After contextualizing the problem within various control architectures, we dissect the ``curse of simulation'' by analyzing the primary sources of sim-to-real gap: robot dynamics, contact modeling, state estimation, and numerical solvers. Building on this diagnosis, we structure the solutions around two complementary philosophies. The first is to shrink the gap through model-centric strategies that systematically improve the simulator's physical fidelity. The second is to harden the policy, a complementary approach that uses in-simulation robustness training and post-deployment adaptation to make the policy inherently resilient to model inaccuracies. The chapter concludes by synthesizing these philosophies into a strategic framework, providing a clear roadmap for developing and evaluating robust sim-to-real solutions.

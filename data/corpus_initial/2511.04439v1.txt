Group-relative Policy Optimization's (GRPO) simplicity makes it highly desirable for adapting LLMs to become experts at specific tasks. But this simplicity also makes it ill-specified as we seek to enhance RL training with richer, non-binary feedback. When using ordinal rewards to give partial credit, GRPO's simplicity starts to hurt, as its group-average baseline often assigns a positive advantage to failed trajectories and reinforces incorrect behavior.
  We introduce Correctness Relative Policy Optimization (CoRPO), a new formulation that solves this flaw. CoRPO uses an adaptive baseline that enforces a minimum quality threshold, ensuring failed solutions are never positively reinforced. Once the policy consistently meets this threshold, the baseline automatically transitions to a relative preference mode, pushing the model to find optimal solutions rather than just "acceptable" ones. We empirically validate CoRPO on a code verification task, where it demonstrates more stable convergence and better out-of-domain generalization.
  This work represents a critical step in our broader research program to enable LLMs to learn genuinely new capabilities through reinforcement learning. We achieve this by enabling LLMs to learn from rich, multi-dimensional feedback - progressing from binary to ordinal rewards in this work, and onward to denser, per-step supervision.

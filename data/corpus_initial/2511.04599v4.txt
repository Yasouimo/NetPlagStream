Understanding feature-outcome associations in high-dimensional data remains
  challenging when relationships vary across subpopulations, yet standard
  methods assuming global associations miss context-dependent patterns, reducing
  statistical power and interpretability. We develop a geometric decomposition
  framework offering two strategies for partitioning inference problems into
  regional analyses on data-derived Riemannian graphs. Gradient flow
  decomposition uses path-monotonicity-validated discrete Morse theory to
  partition samples into gradient flow cells where outcomes exhibit monotonic
  behavior. Co-monotonicity decomposition utilizes vertex-level coefficients
  that provide context-dependent versions of the classical Pearson correlation:
  these coefficients measure edge-based directional concordance between outcome
  and features, or between feature pairs, defining embeddings of samples into
  association space. These embeddings induce Riemannian k-NN graphs on which
  biclustering identifies co-monotonicity cells (coherent regions) and feature
  modules. This extends naturally to multi-modal integration across multiple
  feature sets. Both strategies apply independently or jointly, with Bayesian
  posterior sampling providing credible intervals.

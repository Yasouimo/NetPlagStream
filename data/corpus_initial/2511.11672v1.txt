We introduce OSGym, a super-scalable distributed data engine for training agents across diverse computer-related tasks. OSGym efficiently scales to over a thousand operating system (OS) replicas at an academia-affordable cost, serving as dynamic runtime environments for intelligent agents. It offers three key advantages. (1) Scalability: Despite the intensive resource requirements of running multiple OS replicas, OSGym parallelizes over a thousand instances while maintaining operational efficiency under constrained resources, generating up to 1420 multi-turn trajectories per minute. (2) Generality and Customizability: OSGym supports a broad spectrum of tasks that run on OS platforms, including tool use, browser interactions, software engineering, and office applications, with flexible support for diverse model training algorithms. (3) Economic Viability: OSGym operates at only 0.2-0.3 USD per day per OS replica using accessible on-demand compute providers. It is fully open-source and freely available for both research and commercial use. Experiments show that OSGym enables comprehensive data collection, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning pipelines for computer agents. Models trained with OSGym outperform state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating its potential to advance scalability and universality in future agent research.

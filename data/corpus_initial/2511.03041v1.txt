For over a century, immunology has masterfully discovered and dissected the components of our immune system, yet its collective behavior remains fundamentally unpredictable. In this perspective, we argue that building on the learnings of reductionist biology and systems immunology, the field is poised for a third revolution. This new era will be driven by the convergence of purpose-built, large-scale causal experiments and predictive, generalizable AI models. Here, we propose the Predictive Immunology Loop as the unifying engine to harness this convergence. This closed loop iteratively uses AI to design maximally informative experiments and, in turn, leverages the resulting data to improve dynamic, in silico models of the human immune system across biological scales, culminating in a Virtual Immune System. This engine provides a natural roadmap for addressing immunology's grand challenges, from decoding molecular recognition to engineering tissue ecosystems. It also offers a framework to transform immunology from a descriptive discipline into one capable of forecasting and, ultimately, engineering human health.

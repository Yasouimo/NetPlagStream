Diffusion policies (DPs) achieve state-of-the-art performance on complex manipulation tasks by learning from large-scale demonstration datasets, often spanning multiple embodiments and environments. However, they cannot guarantee safe behavior, so external safety mechanisms are needed. These, however, alter actions in ways unseen during training, causing unpredictable behavior and performance degradation. To address these problems, we propose path-consistent safety filtering (PACS) for DPs. Our approach performs path-consistent braking on a trajectory computed from the sequence of generated actions. In this way, we keep execution consistent with the policy's training distribution, maintaining the learned, task-completing behavior. To enable a real-time deployment and handle uncertainties, we verify safety using set-based reachability analysis. Our experimental evaluation in simulation and on three challenging real-world human-robot interaction tasks shows that PACS (a) provides formal safety guarantees in dynamic environments, (b) preserves task success rates, and (c) outperforms reactive safety approaches, such as control barrier functions, by up to 68% in terms of task success.

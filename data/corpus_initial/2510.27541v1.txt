In this paper, we discuss the matching of the holographic equation of state with the equation of Hadron Resonance Gas for studying the nuclear matter properties within the framework of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Machine learning methods are applied to the calibration of model's free parameters using the lattice QCD results for the physical values of quark masses. One of the most advanced procedures for matching is used with the function that approximate behavior of both models on particular limit adopted from NEOS equation. Final hadronic spectra are obtained within multi-staged numerical approach of the iEBE-MUSIC and SMASH-vHLLE packages. The code of relativistic hydrodynamics is modified by implementing a tabulated holographic equation of state, enabling simulations of quark-gluon plasma evolution with dynamically generated initial conditions via the 3D Monte Carlo Glauber Model and SMASH. Hybrid iSS+UrQMD and Hadron Sampler+SMASH approaches are utilized at the freeze-out stage.

As machine learning systems become increasingly integrated into human-centered domains such as healthcare, ensuring fairness while maintaining high predictive performance is critical. Existing bias mitigation techniques often impose a trade-off between fairness and accuracy, inadvertently degrading performance for certain demographic groups. In high-stakes domains like clinical diagnosis, such trade-offs are ethically and practically unacceptable. In this study, we propose a fairness-without-harm approach by learning distinct representations for different demographic groups and selectively applying demographic experts consisting of group-specific representations and personalized classifiers through a no-harm constrained selection. We evaluate our approach on three real-world medical datasets -- covering eye disease, skin cancer, and X-ray diagnosis -- as well as two face datasets. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving fairness without harm.

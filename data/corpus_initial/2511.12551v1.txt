We present a data-driven analysis of correlation hierarchies in the quarter-filled simple and extended Hubbard models by applying principal component analysis (PCA) to exact-diagonalization (ED) data on 3x4 and 4x4 cylindrical clusters. While the non-interacting limit (U=0) provides a finite-size reference, increasing on-site repulsion U induces localization and reorganizes the low-energy spectrum. For the extended model, we examine moderate (U=4) and strong (U=10) coupling regimes, where conventional structure factors reveal familiar crossovers among charge, spin and local-pairing correlations. PCA of the corresponding correlation matrices captures these crossovers directly from the data, without assuming predefined order parameters by identifying charge-dominated, spin-dominated and pairing-dominated regimes through variance condensation into leading components. This establishes PCA as a transparent, model-agnostic framework for uncovering the hierarchy and competition of correlation channels in finite Hubbard lattice clusters, providing a bridge between exact diagonalization and modern machine-learning diagnostics in strongly correlated systems.

We study finite horizon linear quadratic control with additive noise in a perturbancewise framework that unifies the classical model, a constraint embedded affine policy class, and a distributionally robust formulation with a Wasserstein ambiguity set. Based on an augmented affine representation, we model feasibility as an affine perturbation and unknown noise as distributional perturbation from samples, thereby addressing constrained implementation and model uncertainty in a single scheme. First, we construct an implementable policy gradient method that accommodates nonzero noise means estimated from data. Second, we analyze its convergence under constant stepsizes chosen as simple polynomials of problem parameters, ensuring global decrease of the value function. Finally, numerical studies: mean variance portfolio allocation and dynamic benchmark tracking on real data, validating stable convergence and illuminating sensitivity tradeoffs across horizon length, trading cost intensity, state penalty scale, and estimation window.

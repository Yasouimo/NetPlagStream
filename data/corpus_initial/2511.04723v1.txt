Health prediction is crucial for ensuring reliability, minimizing downtime, and optimizing maintenance in industrial systems. Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction is a key component of this process; however, many existing models struggle to capture fine-grained temporal dependencies while dynamically prioritizing critical features across time for robust prognostics. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that integrates Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) for localized temporal feature extraction with a modified Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) enhanced by Bi-LSTM encoder-decoder. This architecture effectively bridges short- and long-term dependencies while emphasizing salient temporal patterns. Furthermore, the incorporation of a multi-time-window methodology improves adaptability across diverse operating conditions. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model reduces the average RMSE by up to 5.5%, underscoring its improved predictive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. By closing critical gaps in current approaches, this framework advances the effectiveness of industrial prognostic systems and highlights the potential of advanced time-series transformers for RUL prediction.

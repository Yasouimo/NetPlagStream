AI has redefined the boundaries of assistance in education, often blurring the line between guided learning and dependency. This paper revisits Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) through the lens of the P2P Teaching framework. By contrasting temporary scaffolding with the emerging phenomenon of permanent digital mediation, the study introduces the concept of the Zone of No Development (ZND), a state in which continuous assistance replaces cognitive struggle and impedes intellectual autonomy. Through theoretical synthesis and framework design, P2P Teaching demonstrates how deliberate disconnection and ethical fading can restore the learner's agency, ensuring that technological tools enhance rather than replace developmental effort. The paper argues that productive struggle, self-regulation, and first-principles reasoning remain essential for durable learning, and that responsible use of AI in education must include explicit mechanisms to end its help when mastery begins.

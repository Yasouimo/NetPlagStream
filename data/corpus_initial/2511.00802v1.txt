With the software industry shifting toward a data-driven culture, online A/B testing is a key tool for evaluating new technologies. However, deploying such experiments requires substantial resources, may negatively impact users, and involves long data collection periods. To address this, \textit{off-policy evaluation (OPE)}, or offline A/B testing, uses logged data to assess technologies and is fundamental in Reinforcement Learning, making it crucial in domains where online testing is costly or risky, such as healthcare, recommender systems, education, dialog systems, and robotics. Despite advances in coding LLMs and agentic AI, little is known about leveraging them to optimize OPE results. We investigate whether LLMs and LLM-based agents can improve OPE performance via code optimization. We propose \textit{GrowthHacker}, a benchmark with agent and baseline methods on large-scale real-world datasets, which iteratively optimizes code, evaluates results, and begins new optimization cycles. We collected datasets, established protocols, implemented baselines for OPE on the Open Bandit Pipeline (OBP)~\cite{saito2021openbanditdatasetpipeline} and Scope-RL~\cite{kiyohara2023scope}, and developed the \textit{two_agent} framework, which reduces system complexity while preserving optimization effectiveness. Results show the two_agent framework achieves 100% reliability and the highest average improvement of 106.7% among positive outcomes. Both two_agent and CrewAI reach 45% success rates, outperforming AutoGen's 34%. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of LLM-based agents as automated "growth hackers" to enhance OPE systems, with implications for scaling data-driven decision-making in production.

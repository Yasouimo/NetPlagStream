We develop a continuous-time entropy-regularized reinforcement learning framework under model uncertainty. By applying Sion's minimax theorem, we transform the intractable robust control problem into an equivalent standard entropy-regularized stochastic control problem, facilitating reinforcement learning algorithms. We establish sufficient conditions for the theorem's validity and demonstrate our approach on linear-quadratic problems with uncertain model parameters following Bernoulli and uniform distributions.

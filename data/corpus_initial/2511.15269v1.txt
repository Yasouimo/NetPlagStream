----------------------------------------
We introduce jaxFMM, an open-source, adaptive, highly parallel point-charge Fast Multipole Method implementation for the Laplace kernel written in JAX. It is based on a non-uniform refinement strategy, which results in extremely concise and simple code. Benchmarks show that the algorithm performs well even for highly non-uniform charge distributions. JaxFMM already massively speeds up stray-field computations in micromagnetics and with JAX features like autodiff, novel applications such as inverse-design problems and machine-learning tasks can be tackled with ease in the future.

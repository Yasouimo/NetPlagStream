Koopman operator, as a fully linear representation of nonlinear dynamical systems, if well-defined on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), can be efficiently learned from data. For stability analysis and control-related problems, it is desired that the defining RKHS of the Koopman operator should account for both the stability of an equilibrium point (as a local property) and the regularity of the dynamics on the state space (as a global property). To this end, we show that by using the product kernel formed by the linear kernel and a Wendland radial kernel, the resulting RKHS is invariant under the action of Koopman operator (under certain smoothness conditions). Furthermore, when the equilibrium is asymptotically stable, the spectrum of Koopman operator is provably confined inside the unit circle, and escapes therefrom upon bifurcation. Thus, the learned Koopman operator with provable probabilistic error bound provides a stability certificate. In addition to numerical verification, we further discuss how such a fundamental spectrum--stability relation would be useful for Koopman-based control.

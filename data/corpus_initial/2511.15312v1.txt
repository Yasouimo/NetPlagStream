Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) detection and aerial object recognition are critical for modern surveillance and security, prompting a need for robust systems that overcome limitations of single-modality approaches. This research addresses these challenges by designing and rigorously evaluating a novel multimodal Transformer model that integrates diverse data streams: radar, visual band video (RGB), infrared (IR) video, and audio. The architecture effectively fuses distinct features from each modality, leveraging the Transformer's self-attention mechanisms to learn comprehensive, complementary, and highly discriminative representations for classification. The model demonstrated exceptional performance on an independent test set, achieving macro-averaged metrics of 0.9812 accuracy, 0.9873 recall, 0.9787 precision, 0.9826 F1-score, and 0.9954 specificity. Notably, it exhibited particularly high precision and recall in distinguishing drones from other aerial objects. Furthermore, computational analysis confirmed its efficiency, with 1.09 GFLOPs, 1.22 million parameters, and an inference speed of 41.11 FPS, highlighting its suitability for real-time applications. This study presents a significant advancement in aerial object classification, validating the efficacy of multimodal data fusion via a Transformer architecture for achieving state-of-the-art performance, thereby offering a highly accurate and resilient solution for UAV detection and monitoring in complex airspace.

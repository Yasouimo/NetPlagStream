The research explores error analysis in the performance of translating by Machine Translation from English into Romanian, and it focuses on lexical errors found in texts which include official information, provided by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Gavi Organization, by the patient information leaflet (the information about the active ingredients of the vaccines or the medication, the indications, the dosage instructions, the storage instructions, the side effects and warning, etc.). All of these texts are related to Covid-19 and have been translated by Google Translate, a multilingual Machine Translation that was created by Google. In the last decades, Google has actively worked to develop a more accurate and fluent automatic translation system. This research, specifically focused on improving Google Translate, aims to enhance the overall quality of Machine Translation by achieving better lexical selection and by reducing errors. The investigation involves a comprehensive analysis of 230 texts that have been translated from English into Romanian.

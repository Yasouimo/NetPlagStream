Multi-legged robots offer enhanced stability to navigate complex terrains with their multiple legs interacting with the environment. However, how to effectively coordinate the multiple legs in a larger action exploration space to generate natural and robust movements is a key issue. In this paper, we introduce a motion prior-based approach, successfully applying deep reinforcement learning algorithms to a real hexapod robot. We generate a dataset of optimized motion priors, and train an adversarial discriminator based on the priors to guide the hexapod robot to learn natural gaits. The learned policy is then successfully transferred to a real hexapod robot, and demonstrate natural gait patterns and remarkable robustness without visual information in complex terrains. This is the first time that a reinforcement learning controller has been used to achieve complex terrain walking on a real hexapod robot.

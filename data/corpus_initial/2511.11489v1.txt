Transformers are the go-to architecture for most data modalities due to their scalability. While they have been applied extensively to molecular property prediction, they do not dominate the field as they do elsewhere. One cause may be the lack of structural biases that effectively capture the relationships between atoms. Here, we investigate attention biases as a simple and natural way to encode structure. Motivated by physical power laws, we propose a family of low-complexity attention biases $b_{ij} = p \log|| \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j||$ which weigh attention probabilities according to interatomic distances. On the QM9 and SPICE datasets, this approach outperforms positional encodings and graph attention while remaining competitive with more complex Gaussian kernel biases. We also show that good attention biases can compensate for a complete ablation of scaled dot-product attention, suggesting a low-cost path toward interpretable molecular transformers.

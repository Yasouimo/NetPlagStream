We present the discovery of 52 eclipsing quadruple star candidates detected in TESS Full Frame Image eleanor data by machine learning and citizen scientists. The uniformly-vetted and -validated targets exhibit two sets of eclipses following two distinct periods, representing quadruple systems with a 2+2 hierarchical configuration. Detailed photocenter measurements confirmed that both sets of eclipses originate within ~0.1-0.2 pixels (~2-4 arcsec) of the corresponding target, and ruled out resolved nearby field stars. The catalog includes a number of systems producing prominent eclipse timing variations and/or apsidal motion, a quadruple with an outer period of ~1,400 days, and even a 2+2 quadruple in a likely wide quintuple with a resolved co-moving star. Additionally, two systems have complete astrometric solutions for the outer orbits from Gaia. We provide the measured ephemerides, eclipse depths and durations, overall statistical properties, and highlight potentially interesting systems that merit further investigations.

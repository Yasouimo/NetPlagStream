Lost circulation remains a major and costly challenge in drilling operations, often resulting in wellbore instability, stuck pipe, and extended non-productive time. Accurate prediction of fluid loss is therefore essential for improving drilling safety and efficiency. This study presents a probabilistic machine learning framework based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for predicting drilling fluid loss in complex formations. The GPR model captures nonlinear dependencies among drilling parameters while quantifying predictive uncertainty, offering enhanced reliability for high-risk decision-making. Model hyperparameters are optimized using the Limited memory Broyden Fletcher Goldfarb Shanno (LBFGS) algorithm to ensure numerical stability and robust generalization. To improve interpretability, Local Interpretable Model agnostic Explanations (LIME) are employed to elucidate how individual features influence model predictions. The results highlight the potential of explainable probabilistic learning for proactive identification of lost-circulation risks, optimized design of lost circulation materials (LCM), and reduction of operational uncertainties in drilling applications.

Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS) is an unsupervised probing method able to test whether large language models represent binary features, such as sentence truth, in their internal activations. While CCS has shown promise, its two-term objective has been only partially understood. In this work, we revisit CCS with the aim of clarifying its mechanisms and extending its applicability. We argue that what should be optimized for, is relative contrast consistency. Building on this insight, we reformulate CCS as an eigenproblem, yielding closed-form solutions with interpretable eigenvalues and natural extensions to multiple variables. We evaluate these approaches across a range of datasets, finding that they recover similar performance to CCS, while avoiding problems around sensitivity to random initialization. Our results suggest that relativizing contrast consistency not only improves our understanding of CCS but also opens pathways for broader probing and mechanistic interpretability methods.

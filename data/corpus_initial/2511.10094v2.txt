Although recent generative models are remarkably capable of producing instruction-following and realistic outputs, they remain prone to notable physical plausibility failures. Though critical in applications, these physical plausibility errors often escape detection by existing evaluation methods. Furthermore, no framework exists for automatically identifying and interpreting specific physical error patterns in natural language, preventing targeted model improvements. We introduce Matryoshka Transcoders, a novel framework for the automatic discovery and interpretation of physical plausibility features in generative models. Our approach extends the Matryoshka representation learning paradigm to transcoder architectures, enabling hierarchical sparse feature learning at multiple granularity levels. By training on intermediate representations from a physical plausibility classifier and leveraging large multimodal models for interpretation, our method identifies diverse physics-related failure modes without manual feature engineering, achieving superior feature relevance and feature accuracy compared to existing approaches. We utilize the discovered visual patterns to establish a benchmark for evaluating physical plausibility in generative models. Our analysis of eight state-of-the-art generative models provides valuable insights into how these models fail to follow physical constraints, paving the way for further model improvements.

----------------------------------------
Dynamic behaviors are becoming prevalent in many tensor applications. In machine learning, for example, the input tensors are dynamically shaped or ragged, and data-dependent control flow is widely used in many models. However, the limited expressiveness of prior programming abstractions for spatial dataflow accelerators forces the dynamic behaviors to be implemented statically or lacks the visibility for performance-critical decisions. To address these challenges, we present the Streaming Tensor Program (STeP), a new streaming abstraction that enables dynamic tensor workloads to run efficiently on spatial dataflow accelerators. STeP introduces flexible routing operators, an explicit memory hierarchy, and symbolic shape semantics that expose dynamic data rates and tensor dimensions. These capabilities unlock new optimizations-dynamic tiling, dynamic parallelization, and configuration time-multiplexing-that adapt to dynamic behaviors while preserving dataflow efficiency. Using a cycle-approximate simulator on representative LLM layers with real-world traces, dynamic tiling reduces on-chip memory requirement by 2.18x, dynamic parallelization improves latency by 1.5x, and configuration time-multiplexing improves compute utilization by 2.57x over implementations available in prior abstractions.

Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), a widely used thermoplastic in packaging, textiles, and engineering applications, is valued for its strength, clarity, and chemical resistance. Increasing environmental impact concerns and regulatory pressures drive the search for alternatives with comparable or superior performance. We present an AI-driven polymer design pipeline employing virtual forward synthesis (VFS) to generate PET-replacement copolymers. Inspired by the esterification route of PET synthesis, we systematically combined a down-selected set of Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)-listed monomers to create 12,100 PET-like polymers. Machine learning models predicted glass transition temperature (Tg), band gap, and tendency to crystallize, for all designs. Multi-objective screening identified 1,108 candidates predicted to match or exceed PET in $T_{\rm g}$ and band gap, including the ``rediscovery'' of other known commercial PET-alternate polymers (e.g., PETG, Tritan, Ecozen) that provide retrospective validation of our design pipeline, demonstrating a capability to rapidly design experimentally feasible polymers at a scale. Furthermore, selected, entirely new (previously unknown) candidates designed here have been synthesized and characterized, providing a definitive validation of the design framework.

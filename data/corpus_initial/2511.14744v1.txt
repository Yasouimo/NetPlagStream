Deep learning's rise since the early 2010s has transformed fields like computer vision and natural language processing and strongly influenced biomedical research. For drug discovery specifically, a key inflection - akin to vision's "ImageNet moment" - arrived in 2015, when deep neural networks surpassed traditional approaches on the Tox21 Data Challenge. This milestone accelerated the adoption of deep learning across the pharmaceutical industry, and today most major companies have integrated these methods into their research pipelines. After the Tox21 Challenge concluded, its dataset was included in several established benchmarks, such as MoleculeNet and the Open Graph Benchmark. However, during these integrations, the dataset was altered and labels were imputed or manufactured, resulting in a loss of comparability across studies. Consequently, the extent to which bioactivity and toxicity prediction methods have improved over the past decade remains unclear. To this end, we introduce a reproducible leaderboard, hosted on Hugging Face with the original Tox21 Challenge dataset, together with a set of baseline and representative methods. The current version of the leaderboard indicates that the original Tox21 winner - the ensemble-based DeepTox method - and the descriptor-based self-normalizing neural networks introduced in 2017, continue to perform competitively and rank among the top methods for toxicity prediction, leaving it unclear whether substantial progress in toxicity prediction has been achieved over the past decade. As part of this work, we make all baselines and evaluated models publicly accessible for inference via standardized API calls to Hugging Face Spaces.

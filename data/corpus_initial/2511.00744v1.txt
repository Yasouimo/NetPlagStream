Various coils for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) are widely available for clinical and research use. These coils are almost all designed as air coils, which require large levels of energy to achieve a given magnetic flux density and in turn electric field strength, whereas in other sectors, such as power electronics or electrical machines, magnetic materials have been used for a long time to achieve higher efficiencies. We tested the impact on the electric and magnetic properties of different soft magnetic materials, including various ferrite cores, laminated sheet materials of nonisotropic corn-oriented silicon-steel, non-oriented silicon-steel, as well as cobalt-iron, and soft magnetic compound powder cores with insulated particles. Every material led to a reduction in coil current and voltage for the same target electric field strength. For the same field energy, every material yielded lower losses. Most common materials saturated already at very low currents. More material in thicker layers could shift the saturation point but at the cost of high weight. Due to their low saturation flux density, ferrites appear unsuitable for the high amplitude requirements of TMS. Laminated sheet materials and powder cores reduce the pulse energy, but the laminated sheet material adds more weight for the same effect than powder cores. Thus, appropriate magnetic materials can reduce the required pulse energy. Saturation flux density is the most relevant parameter, whereas the permeability beyond a certain base level is practically irrelevant. Most importantly, the weight of a magnetic-core coil may always be increased compared to an air coil for the same target field.

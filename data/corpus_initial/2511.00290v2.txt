NOMAD (Navigating Optimal Model Application for Datastreams) is an intelligent framework for data enrichment during ingestion that optimizes realtime multiclass classification by dynamically constructing model chains, i.e ,sequences of machine learning models with varying cost-quality tradeoffs, selected via a utilitybased criterion. Inspired by predicate ordering techniques from database query processing, NOMAD leverages cheaper models as initial filters, proceeding to more expensive models only when necessary, while guaranteeing classification quality remains comparable to a designated role model through a formal chain safety mechanism. It employs a dynamic belief update strategy to adapt model selection based on per event predictions and shifting data distributions, and extends to scenarios with dependent models such as earlyexit DNNs and stacking ensembles. Evaluation across multiple datasets demonstrates that NOMAD achieves significant computational savings compared to static and naive approaches while maintaining classification quality comparable to that achieved by the most accurate (and often the most expensive) model.

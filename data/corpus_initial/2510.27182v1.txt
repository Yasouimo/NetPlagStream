Dynamic offloading of Machine Learning (ML) model partitions across different resource orchestration services, such as Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), can balance processing and transmission delays while minimizing costs of adaptive inference applications. However, prior work often overlooks real-world factors, such as Virtual Machine (VM) cold starts, requests under long-tail service time distributions, etc. To tackle these limitations, we model each ML query (request) as traversing an acyclic sequence of stages, wherein each stage constitutes a contiguous block of sparse model parameters ending in an internal or final classifier where requests may exit. Since input-dependent exit rates vary, no single resource configuration suits all query distributions. IaaS-based VMs become underutilized when many requests exit early, yet rapidly scaling to handle request bursts reaching deep layers is impractical. SERFLOW addresses this challenge by leveraging FaaS-based serverless functions (containers) and using stage-specific resource provisioning that accounts for the fraction of requests exiting at each stage. By integrating this provisioning with adaptive load balancing across VMs and serverless functions based on request ingestion, SERFLOW reduces cloud costs by over $23\%$ while efficiently adapting to dynamic workloads.

We present the first unified framework that jointly handles three operationally heterogeneous saliency tasks, eg, SOD, CoSOD, and SIS, by casting each as a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning process in a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to bridge task heterogeneity. CoT training follows a two-stage paradigm: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). To enhance CoT quality in RL, we propose Confidence-Guided Policy Optimization (CGPO), a lightweight single-sample algorithm that leverages the discrepancy between reward and model confidence as a per-sample advantage signal. This design naturally focuses updates on informative responses while eliminating group sampling, thereby addressing GRPO's key limitations: confidence-agnostic learning, signal dilution, and prohibitive computational overhead. We also introduce an "output-to-reasoning" strategy to construct high-fidelity SFT data that ensures logical consistency with ground-truth masks. Experiments show our model matches or outperforms specialized SOTA methods and strong closed-source VLMs across all tasks, especially achieving an S-measure of 0.899 on CoCA for CoSOD, surpassing the prior best by 8.0 percentage points, despite using far less training data.

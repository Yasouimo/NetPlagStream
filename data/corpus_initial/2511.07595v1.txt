In this work, we introduce TurkEmbed4Retrieval, a retrieval specialized variant of the TurkEmbed model originally designed for Natural Language Inference (NLI) and Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) tasks. By fine-tuning the base model on the MS MARCO TR dataset using advanced training techniques, including Matryoshka representation learning and a tailored multiple negatives ranking loss, we achieve SOTA performance for Turkish retrieval tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms Turkish colBERT by 19,26% on key retrieval metrics for the Scifact TR dataset, thereby establishing a new benchmark for Turkish information retrieval.

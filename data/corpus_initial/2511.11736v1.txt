This paper proposes KAN/H, a variant of Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) that uses a Haar-variant basis system having both global and local bases instead of B-spline. The resulting algorithm is applied to function approximation problems and MNIST. We show that it does not require most of the problem-specific hyper-parameter tunings.

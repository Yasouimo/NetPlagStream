Aerosol Jet (AJ) printing is a versatile additive manufacturing technique capable of producing high-resolution interconnects on both 2D and 3D substrates. The AJ process is complex and dynamic with many hidden and unobservable states that influence the machine performance, including aerosol particle diameter, aerosol carrier density, vial level, and ink deposition in the tube and nozzle. Despite its promising potential, the widespread adoption of AJ printing is limited by inconsistencies in print quality that often stem from variability in these hidden states. To address these challenges, we develop a digital twin model of the AJ process that offers real-time insights into the machine's operations. The digital twin is built around a physics-based macro-model created through simulation and experimentation. The states and parameters of the digital model are continuously updated using probabilistic sequential estimation techniques to closely align with real-time measurements extracted from the AJ system's sensor and video data. The result is a digital model of the AJ process that continuously evolves over a physical machine's lifecycle. The digital twin enables accurate monitoring of unobservable physical characteristics, detects and predicts anomalous behavior, and forecasts the effect of control adjustments. This work presents a comprehensive end-to-end digital twin framework that integrates customized computer vision techniques, physics-based macro-modeling, and advanced probabilistic estimation methods to construct an evolving digital representation of the AJ equipment and process. While the methodologies are customized for aerosol jet printing, the process for constructing the digital twin can be applied for other advanced manufacturing techniques.

The solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) plays a central role in numerous applications in science and engineering, particularly those involving multiphase flow in porous media. Complex, nonlinear systems govern these problems and are notoriously computationally intensive, especially in real-world applications and reservoirs. Recent advances in deep learning have spurred the development of data-driven surrogate models that approximate PDE solutions with reduced computational cost. Among these, Neural Operators such as Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) and Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet) have shown strong potential for learning parameter-to-solution mappings, enabling the generalization across families of PDEs. However, both methods face challenges when applied independently to complex porous media flows, including high memory requirements and difficulty handling the time dimension. To address these limitations, this work introduces hybrid neural operator surrogates based on DeepONet models that integrate Fourier Neural Operators, Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) within their branch and trunk networks. The proposed framework decouples spatial and temporal learning tasks by splitting these structures into the branch and trunk networks, respectively. We evaluate these hybrid models on multiphase flow in porous media problems ranging in complexity from the steady 2D Darcy flow to the 2D and 3D problems belonging to the $10$th Comparative Solution Project from the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Results demonstrate that hybrid schemes achieve accurate surrogate modeling with significantly fewer parameters while maintaining strong predictive performance on large-scale reservoir simulations.

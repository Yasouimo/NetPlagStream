Accurate and efficient prediction of electronic wavefunctions is central to ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and electronic structure theory. However, conventional ab initio methods require self-consistent optimization of electronic states at every nuclear configuration, leading to prohibitive computational costs, especially for large or strongly correlated systems. Here, we introduce a quantum-centric machine learning (QCML) model-a hybrid quantum-classical framework that integrates parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) with Transformer-based machine learning to directly predict molecular wavefunctions and quantum observables. By pretraining the Transformer on a diverse dataset of molecules and ansatz types and subsequently fine-tuning it for specific systems, QCML learns transferable mappings between molecular descriptors and PQC parameters, eliminating the need for iterative variational optimization. The pretrained model achieves chemical accuracy in potential energy surfaces, atomic forces, and dipole moments across multiple molecules and ansatzes, and enables efficient AIMD simulations with infrared spectra prediction. This work establishes a scalable and transferable quantum-centric machine learning paradigm, bridging variational quantum algorithms and modern deep learning for next-generation molecular simulation and quantum chemistry applications.

We reveal intrinsic fracture nonreciprocity, manifesting as directional asymmetry in crack resistance, in two-dimensional heterostructures engineered through lattice-mismatched interfaces. Density-functional theory combined with machine-learning molecular dynamics show that intrinsic lattice mismatch between bonded component crystals imprints asymmetric prestrain states at crack tips, governing bond-breaking thresholds through charge redistribution. The failure criterion obeys a universal exponential scaling law between normalized charge density and bond strain, insensitive to bonding chemistry and local atomic environment. The magnitude of nonreciprocity scales systematically with lattice mismatch, reaching 49% at 10% mismatch. Validation across hexagonal, square, rectangular, and oblique two-dimensional lattices confirms universality, establishing interface strain engineering as a general design principle that bridges electronic structure to nanoscale failure, enabling rational design of damage-tolerant nanostructures.

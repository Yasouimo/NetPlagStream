Dark matter (DM) halos form hierarchically in the Universe through a series of merger events. Cosmological simulations can represent this series of mergers as a graph-like ``tree'' structure. Previous work has shown these merger trees are sensitive to cosmology simulation parameters, but as DM structures, the outstanding question of their sensitivity to DM models remains unanswered. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of deep learning methods trained on merger trees to infer Warm Dark Matter (WDM) particles masses from the DREAMS simulation suite. We organize the merger trees from 1,024 zoom-in simulations into graphs with nodes representing the merger history of galaxies and edges denoting hereditary links. We vary the complexity of the node features included in the graphs ranging from a single node feature up through an array of several galactic properties (e.g., halo mass, star formation rate, etc.). We train a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to predict the WDM mass using the graph representation of the merger tree as input. We find that the GNN can predict the mass of the WDM particle ($R^2$ from 0.07 to 0.95), with success depending on the graph complexity and node features. We extend the same methods to supernovae and active galactic nuclei feedback parameters $A_\text{SN1}$, $A_\text{SN2}$, and $A_\text{AGN}$, successfully inferring the supernovae parameters. The GNN can even infer the WDM mass from merger tree histories without any node features, indicating that the structure of merger trees alone inherits information about the cosmological parameters of the simulations from which they form.

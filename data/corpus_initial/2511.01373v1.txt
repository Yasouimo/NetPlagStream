The integration of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) and fluid antenna systems (FAS) has attracted considerable attention due to its tremendous potential in enhancing wireless communication performance. However, under fast-fading channel conditions, rapidly and effectively performing joint optimization of the antenna positions in an FAS system and the RIS phase configuration remains a critical challenge. Traditional optimization methods typically rely on complex iterative computations, thus making it challenging to obtain optimal solutions in real time within dynamic channel environments. To address this issue, this paper introduces a field information-driven optimization method based on three-dimensional Gaussian radiation-field modeling for real-time optimization of integrated FAS-RIS systems. In the proposed approach, obstacles are treated as virtual transmitters and, by separately learning the amplitude and phase variations, the model can quickly generate high-precision channel information based on the transmitter's position. This design eliminates the need for extensive pilot overhead and cumbersome computations. On this framework, an alternating optimization scheme is presented to jointly optimize the FAS position and the RIS phase configuration. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of spectrum prediction accuracy, convergence speed, and minimum achievable rate, validating its effectiveness and practicality in fast-fading scenarios.

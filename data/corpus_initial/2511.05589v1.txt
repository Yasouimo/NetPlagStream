Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training has become a trending paradigm for enhancing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Most existing RL systems for LLMs operate in a fully synchronous manner, where training must wait for the rollout of an entire batch to complete. This design leads to severe inefficiencies, as extremely long trajectories can stall the entire rollout process and leave many GPUs idle. To address this issue, we propose Concurrency- Controlled Partial Rollout with Importance Sampling (CoPRIS), which mitigates long-tail inefficiencies by maintaining a fixed number of concurrent rollouts, early-terminating once sufficient samples are collected, and reusing unfinished trajectories in subsequent rollouts. To mitigate the impact of off-policy trajectories, we introduce Cross-stage Importance Sampling Correction, which concatenates buffered log probabilities from the previous policy with those recomputed under the current policy for importance sampling correction. Experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that CoPRIS achieves up to 1.94x faster training while maintaining comparable or superior performance to synchronous RL systems.

This study explores whether large language models (LLMs) can simulate valid student responses for educational measurement. Using GPT -4o, 2000 virtual student personas were generated. Each persona completed the Academic Motivation Scale (AMS). Factor analyses(EFA and CFA) and clustering showed GPT -4o reproduced the AMS structure and distinct motivational subgroups.

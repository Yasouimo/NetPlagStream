Dilithium is one of the NIST approved lattice-based signature schemes. In this short note we describe the Bai-Galbraith signature scheme proposed in BG14, which differs to Dilithium, due to the fact that there is no public key compression. This lattice-based signature scheme is based on Learning with Errors (LWE).

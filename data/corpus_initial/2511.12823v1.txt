Over the past few years, improving LLM code generation capabilities has been a key focus in NLP research. Despite Bengali having 242 million native speakers worldwide, it receives little attention when it comes to training LLMs. More recently, various fine-tuning and augmented generation techniques have been employed to significantly enhance code generation performance. However, they require considerable expertise and resources to utilize effectively as an end user. The goal of our work is to democratize access to powerful code generation tools in resource-constrained emerging markets, enabling users to leverage them in their native language.
  We introduce a novel approach that combines Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Code Interpreter (CI), utilizing open-weight models, which improves the baseline accuracy for code generation with Bengali prompts and achieves an overall accuracy of 85%. Our approach requires no finetuning and proves that even the smallest models in the same family can attain up to 98% accuracy compared to the largest models. All of our results are publicly shared in GitHub for validation and reproducibility.

Symbol decoding in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication systems requires the deployment of fast, energy-efficient computing hardware deployable at the edge. The brute-force, exact maximum likelihood (ML) decoder, solved on conventional classical digital hardware, has exponential time complexity. Approximate classical solvers implemented on the same hardware have polynomial time complexity at the best. In this article, we design an alternative ring-oscillator-based coupled oscillator array to act as an oscillator Ising machine (OIM) and heuristically solve the ML-based MIMO detection problem. Complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology is used to design the ring oscillators, and ferroelectric field effect transistor (FeFET) technology is chosen as the coupling element (X) between the oscillators in this CMOS + X OIM design. For this purpose, we experimentally report high linear range of conductance variation (1 micro-S to 60 micro-S) in a FeFET device fabricated at 28 nm high-K/ metal gate (HKMG) CMOS technology node. We incorporate the conductance modulation characteristic in SPICE simulation of the ring oscillators connected in an all-to-all fashion through a crossbar array of these FeFET devices. We show that the above range of conductance variation of the FeFET device is suitable to obtain optimum OIM performance with no significant performance drop up to a MIMO size of 100 transmitting and 100 receiving antennas, thereby making FeFET a suitable device for this application. Our simulations and associated analysis using the Kuramoto model of oscillators also predict that this designed classical analog OIM, if implemented experimentally, will offer logarithmic scaling of computation time with MIMO size, thereby offering a huge improvement (in terms of computation speed) over aforementioned MIMO decoders run on conventional digital hardware.

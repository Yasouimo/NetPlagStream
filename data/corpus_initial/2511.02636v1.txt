The study introduces the Adaptive Quantum Ising Agents (AQIA) framework, a Hamiltonian-based methodology that extends programmable quantum matter into an adaptive domain. Each agent operates as a finite transverse-field Ising subsystem, maintaining internal quantum coherence while interacting through state-dependent feedback channels characterised by reduced observables such as spin polarisation, bond correlation, and internal energy. These informational couplings enable the transformation of a static lattice into a feedback-reconfigurable medium. The effective Hamiltonian generated, which remains Hermitian at each iteration, is resolved self-consistently using a mean-field approximation, where the feedback fields are iteratively adjusted to minimise the total energy. Numerical investigations identify three distinct regimes: domain formation near the feedback--fluctuation critical point, glass-like frustration due to competing feedback channels, and modular polarisation sustained by structured interactions. These phenomena occur independently of geometric embedding, illustrating that informational similarity alone can induce coherent organisation. The AQIA framework is adaptable to implementation on superconducting, trapped-ion, or Rydberg platforms, offering a minimalistic model for exploring self-organisation and learning in adaptive programmable quantum matter.

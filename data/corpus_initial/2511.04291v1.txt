Minimum-volume nonnegative matrix factorization (min-vol NMF) has been used successfully in many applications, such as hyperspectral imaging, chemical kinetics, spectroscopy, topic modeling, and audio source separation. However, its robustness to noise has been a long-standing open problem. In this paper, we prove that min-vol NMF identifies the groundtruth factors in the presence of noise under a condition referred to as the expanded sufficiently scattered condition which requires the data points to be sufficiently well scattered in the latent simplex generated by the basis vectors.

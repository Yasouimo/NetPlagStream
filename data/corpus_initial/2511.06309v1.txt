We introduce the STATION, an open-world multi-agent environment that models a miniature scientific ecosystem. Leveraging their extended context windows, agents in the Station can engage in long scientific journeys that include reading papers from peers, formulating hypotheses, submitting code, performing analyses, and publishing results. Importantly, there is no centralized system coordinating their activities - agents are free to choose their own actions and develop their own narratives within the Station. Experiments demonstrate that AI agents in the Station achieve new state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of benchmarks, spanning from mathematics to computational biology to machine learning, notably surpassing AlphaEvolve in circle packing. A rich tapestry of narratives emerges as agents pursue independent research, interact with peers, and build upon a cumulative history. From these emergent narratives, novel methods arise organically, such as a new density-adaptive algorithm for scRNA-seq batch integration. The Station marks a first step towards autonomous scientific discovery driven by emergent behavior in an open-world environment, representing a new paradigm that moves beyond rigid optimization.

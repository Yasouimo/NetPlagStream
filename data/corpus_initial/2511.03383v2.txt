Existing Machine Translation (MT) research often suggests a single, fixed set of hyperparameters for word segmentation models, symmetric Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), which applies the same number of merge operations (NMO) to train tokenizers for both source and target languages. However, we demonstrate that this uniform approach doesn't guarantee optimal MT performance across different language pairs and data sizes. This work investigates BPE segmentation recipes across various data volumes and language pairs to evaluate MT system performance. We find that utilizing asymmetric BPE, where the source and target languages have different NMOs, significantly improves results over the symmetric approach, especially in low-resource settings (50K, 100K, and 500K sentence pairs). Specifically, asymmetric BPE yield statistically significant ($p<0.05$) average gains of 5.32, 4.46, and 0.7 CHRF++ on English-Hindi in low-resource setups (50K, 100K, and 500K sentence pairs, respectively). We validated this trend across six additional language pairs (English and Telugu, Shona, Norwegian, Kyrgyz, Hausa, and Inuktitut), observing statistically significant improvement in 10 out of 12 systems compared to symmetric BPE. Our findings indicate a high NMO for the source (4K to 32K) and a low NMO for the target (0.5K to 2K) provides optimal results, particularly benefiting low-resource MT.

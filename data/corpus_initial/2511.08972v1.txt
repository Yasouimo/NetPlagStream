Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) has gained prominence as a scalable and computationally efficient architecture, enabling significant growth in model capacity without incurring additional inference costs. However, existing SMoE models often rely on auxiliary losses (e.g., z-loss, load balancing) and additional trainable parameters (e.g., noisy gating) to encourage expert diversity, leading to objective misalignment and increased model complexity. Moreover, existing Sinkhorn-based methods suffer from significant training overhead due to their heavy reliance on the computationally expensive Sinkhorn algorithm. In this work, we formulate token-to-expert assignment as an optimal transport problem, incorporating constraints to ensure balanced expert utilization. We demonstrate that introducing a minimal degree of optimal transport-based routing enhances SMoE performance without requiring auxiliary balancing losses. Unlike previous methods, our approach derives gating scores directly from the transport map, enabling more effective token-to-expert balancing, supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical results. Building on these insights, we propose Selective Sinkhorn Routing (SSR), a routing mechanism that replaces auxiliary loss with lightweight Sinkhorn-based routing. SSR promotes balanced token assignments while preserving flexibility in expert selection. Across both language modeling and image classification tasks, SSR achieves faster training, higher accuracy, and greater robustness to input corruption.

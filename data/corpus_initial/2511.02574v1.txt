This paper proposes a novel formulation of effective regional inertia that explicitly accounts for both system topology and the spatial distribution of inertia. Unlike traditional approaches that model a region as an aggregated machine with an equivalent inertia, the proposed metric provides a topology-aware representation. The methodology builds on an analytical framework that extends classical slow coherency theory to address network partitioning and regional frequency stability. Based on these partitions, we develop a systematic procedure to evaluate the effective inertia of each region, enabling a more accurate interpretation of local inertial contributions, including those from virtual inertia provided by inverter-based resources (IBRs). Case studies on the IEEE 39-bus and 68-bus systems demonstrate that the integration of inertial devices does not uniformly improve system frequency response, underscoring the importance of the proposed metric for effective regional inertia assessment.

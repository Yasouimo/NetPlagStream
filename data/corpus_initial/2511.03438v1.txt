We present a fast data processing system for the Baikal-GVD neutrino telescope, designed for rapid identification of astrophysical neutrino events. Leveraging Baikal-GVD's modular cluster architecture, the system implements parallelized file processing where raw data files undergo concurrent analysis across dedicated virtual machines. The system implements two pipelines: a fast per-file processing and a fully fledged (per-run) processing, which integrates dynamic detector geometry determined from acoustic and inertial positioning systems and data quality monitoring with a latency of about 27 hr. The fast processing pipeline delivers a total latency of about 1.5-18 minutes from event detection to reconstructed data availability, depending on water luminescence levels. This enables fast follow-up observations of transient astrophysical sources, fulfilling Baikal-GVD's role in multi-messenger networks. The article also highlights key features of the data acquisition system, the integration of advanced synchronization systems and a robust infrastructure for data handling and storage, ensuring efficient and reliable operation of the Baikal-GVD telescope.

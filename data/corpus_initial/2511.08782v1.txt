The Hohenberg-Kohn (HK) theorem -- the bedrock of density functional theory (DFT) -- establishes a universal map from the external potential to the energy. It also relates the electron density and atomic forces to the variation of the energy with the external potential. But the HK map is rarely utilized in atomistics, wherein interatomic potentials are defined using the molecular or crystal structure rather than the external potential. As a break from this tradition, we present a field theoretic atomistics framework where the external potential assumes the central quantity. We machine learn the HK energy map while satisfying the thermodynamic limit. Further, we obtain both forces and electron density from the variation of the HK energy map, that are exact relations. Our models attain good accuracy across diverse benchmarks and compete with state-of-the-art machine learned interatomic potentials. Through electron density, we predict accurate dipole and quadrupole moments, otherwise nontrivial for interatomic potentials. Our formulation paves the way for a scalable electronic structure surrogate to DFT.

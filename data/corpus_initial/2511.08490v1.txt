Concentric tube robots (CTRs) offer dexterous motion at millimeter scales, enabling minimally invasive procedures through natural orifices. This work presents a coordinated model-based resection planner and learning-based retraction network that work together to enable semi-autonomous tissue resection using a dual-arm transurethral concentric tube robot (the Virtuoso). The resection planner operates directly on segmented CT volumes of prostate phantoms, automatically generating tool trajectories for a three-phase median lobe resection workflow: left/median trough resection, right/median trough resection, and median blunt dissection. The retraction network, PushCVAE, trained on surgeon demonstrations, generates retractions according to the procedural phase. The procedure is executed under Level-3 (supervised) autonomy on a prostate phantom composed of hydrogel materials that replicate the mechanical and cutting properties of tissue. As a feasibility study, we demonstrate that our combined autonomous system achieves a 97.1% resection of the targeted volume of the median lobe. Our study establishes a foundation for image-guided autonomy in transurethral robotic surgery and represents a first step toward fully automated minimally-invasive prostate enucleation.

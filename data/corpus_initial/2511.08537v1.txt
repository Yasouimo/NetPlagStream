This report presents a detailed methodology for constructing a high-quality Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) dataset from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the OntoNotes 5.0 corpus and adapting it for Opinion Role Labeling (ORL) tasks. Leveraging the PropBank annotation framework, we implement a reproducible extraction pipeline that aligns predicate-argument structures with surface text, converts syntactic tree pointers to coherent spans, and applies rigorous cleaning to ensure semantic fidelity. The resulting dataset comprises 97,169 predicate-argument instances with clearly defined Agent (ARG0), Predicate (REL), and Patient (ARG1) roles, mapped to ORL's Holder, Expression, and Target schema. We provide a detailed account of our extraction algorithms, discontinuous argument handling, annotation corrections, and statistical analysis of the resulting dataset. This work offers a reusable resource for researchers aiming to leverage SRL for enhancing ORL, especially in low-resource opinion mining scenarios.

The transition from the Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles (ICEVs) to the Electric Vehicles (EVs) is globally recommended to combat the unfavourable environmental conditions caused by reliance on fossil fuels. However, it has been established that the charging of EVs can destabilize the grid when they penetrate the market in large numbers, especially in grids that were not initially built to handle the load from the charging of EVs. In this work, we present a dynamic EV charging pricing strategy that fulfills the following three objectives: distribution network-level load peak-shaving, valley-filling, and load balancing across distribution networks. Based on historical environmental variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, EV charging prices and distribution of vehicles in different areas in different times of the day, we first forecast the distribution network load demand, and then use deep reinforcement learning approach to set the optimal dynamic EV charging price. While most research seeks to achieve load peak-shaving and valley-filling to stabilize the grid, our work goes further into exploring the load-balancing between the distribution networks in the close vicinity to each other. We compare the performance of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithms for this purpose. The best algorithm is used for dymamic EV pricing. Simulation results show an improved utilization of the grid at the distribution network level, leading to the optimal usage of the grid on a larger scale.

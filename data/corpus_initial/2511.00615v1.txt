We present a unified, data-driven framework for quantifying and enhancing offensive momentum and scoring likelihood (expected goals, xG) in professional hockey. Leveraging a Sportlogiq dataset of 541,000 NHL event records, our end-to-end pipeline comprises five stages: (1) interpretable momentum weighting of micro-events via logistic regression; (2) nonlinear xG estimation using gradient-boosted decision trees; (3) temporal sequence modeling with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks; (4) spatial formation discovery through principal component analysis (PCA) followed by K-Means clustering on standardized player coordinates; and (5) use of an X-Learner causal inference estimator to quantify the average treatment effect (ATE) of adopting the identified "optimal" event sequences and formations. We observe an ATE of 0.12 (95% CI: 0.05-0.17, p < 1e-50), corresponding to a 15% relative gain in scoring potential. These results demonstrate that strategically structured sequences and compact formations causally elevate offensive performance. Our framework delivers real-time, actionable insights for coaches and analysts, advancing hockey analytics toward principled, causally grounded tactical optimization.

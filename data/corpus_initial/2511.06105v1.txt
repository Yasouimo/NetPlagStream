Accurate thermospheric density prediction is crucial for reliable satellite operations in Low Earth Orbits, especially at high solar and geomagnetic activity. Physics-based models such as TIE-GCM offer high fidelity but are computationally expensive, while empirical models like NRLMSIS are efficient yet lack predictive power. This work presents a transformer-based model that forecasts densities up to three days ahead and is intended as a drop-in replacement for an empirical baseline. Unlike recent approaches, it avoids spatial reduction and complex input pipelines, operating directly on a compact input set. Validated on real-world data, the model improves key prediction metrics and shows potential to support mission planning.

This article presents a Multi-Modal Bipedal Intelligent Urban Scout robot (MOBIUS) capable of walking, crawling, climbing, and rolling. MOBIUS features four limbs--two 6-DoF arms with two-finger grippers for manipulation and climbing, and two 4-DoF legs for locomotion--enabling smooth transitions across diverse terrains without reconfiguration. A hybrid control architecture combines reinforcement learning-based locomotion with model-based predictive and admittance control enhanced for safety by a Reference Governor toward compliant contact interactions. A high-level MIQCP planner autonomously selects locomotion modes to balance stability and energy efficiency. Hardware experiments demonstrate robust gait transitions, dynamic climbing, and full-body load support via pinch grasp. Overall, MOBIUS demonstrates the importance of tight integration between morphology, high-level planning, and control to enable mobile loco-manipulation and grasping, substantially expanding its interaction capabilities, workspace, and traversability.

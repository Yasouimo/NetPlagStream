Despite their often perceived static and slow nature, some plants can move faster than the blink of an eye. The rapid snap closure motion of the Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) has long captivated the interest of researchers and engineers alike, serving as a model for plant-inspired soft machines and robots. The translation of the fast snapping closure has inspired the development of various artificial Venus flytrap (AVF) systems. However, translating both the closing and reopening motion of D. muscipula into an autonomous plant inspired soft machine has yet to be achieved. In this study, we present an AVF that autonomously closes and reopens, utilizing novel thermo-responsive UV-curable shape memory materials for soft robotic systems. The life-sized thermo-responsive AVF exhibits closing and reopening motions triggered in a naturally occurring temperature range. The doubly curved trap lobes, built from shape memory polymers, close at 38°C, while reopening initiates around 45°C, employing shape memory elastomer strips as antagonistic actuators to facilitate lobe reopening. This work represents the first demonstration of thermo-responsive closing and reopening in an AVF with programmed sequential motion in response to increasing temperature. This approach marks the next step toward autonomously bidirectional moving soft machines/robots.

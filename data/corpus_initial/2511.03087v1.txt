Generalized linear models (GLMs) are fundamental tools for statistical modeling, with maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) serving as the classical method for parameter inference. While MLE performs well in canonical GLMs, it can become computationally inefficient near the true parameter value. In more general settings with non-canonical or fully general link functions, the resulting optimization landscape is often non-convex, non-smooth, and numerically unstable. To address these challenges, we investigate an alternative estimator based on solving the variational inequality (VI) formulation of the GLM likelihood equations, originally proposed by Juditsky and Nemirovski as an alternative for solving nonlinear least-squares problems. Unlike their focus on algorithmic convergence in monotone settings, we analyze the VI approach from a statistical perspective, comparing it systematically with the MLE. We also extend the theory of VI estimators to a broader class of link functions, including non-monotone cases satisfying a strong Minty condition, and show that it admits weaker smoothness requirements than MLE, enabling faster, more stable, and less locally trapped optimization. Theoretically, we establish both non-asymptotic estimation error bounds and asymptotic normality for the VI estimator, and further provide convergence guarantees for fixed-point and stochastic approximation algorithms. Numerical experiments show that the VI framework preserves the statistical efficiency of MLE while substantially extending its applicability to more challenging GLM settings.

----------------------------------------
Standard-to-dialect machine translation remains challenging due to a persistent dialect gap in large language models and evaluation distortions inherent in n-gram metrics, which favor source copying over authentic dialect translation. In this paper, we propose the dialect refinement (DIA-REFINE) framework, which guides LLMs toward faithful target dialect outputs through an iterative loop of translation, verification, and feedback using external dialect classifiers. To address the limitations of n-gram-based metrics, we introduce the dialect fidelity score (DFS) to quantify linguistic shift and the target dialect ratio (TDR) to measure the success of dialect translation. Experiments on Korean dialects across zero-shot and in-context learning baselines demonstrate that DIA-REFINE consistently enhances dialect fidelity. The proposed metrics distinguish between False Success cases, where high n-gram scores obscure failures in dialectal translation, and True Attempt cases, where genuine attempts at dialectal translation yield low n-gram scores. We also observed that models exhibit varying degrees of responsiveness to the framework, and that integrating in-context examples further improves the translation of dialectal expressions. Our work establishes a robust framework for goal-directed, inclusive dialect translation, providing both rigorous evaluation and critical insights into model performance.

In this work, we benchmark two recently developed deep density methods for nonlinear filtering. Starting from the Fokker--Planck equation with Bayes updates, we model the filtering density of a discretely observed SDE. The two filters: the deep splitting filter and the deep BSDE filter, are both based on Feynman--Kac formulas, Euler--Maruyama discretizations and neural networks. The two methods are extended to logarithmic formulations providing sound and robust implementations in increasing state dimension. Comparing to the classical particle filters and ensemble Kalman filters, we benchmark the methods on numerous examples. In the low-dimensional examples the particle filters work well, but when we scale up to a partially observed 100-dimensional Lorenz-96 model the particle-based methods fail and the logarithmic deep density method prevails. In terms of computational efficiency, the deep density methods reduce inference time by roughly two to five orders of magnitude relative to the particle-based filters.

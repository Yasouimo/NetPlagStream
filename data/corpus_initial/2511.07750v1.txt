----------------------------------------
Navigating complex real-world environments requires semantic understanding and adaptive decision-making. Traditional reactive methods without maps often fail in cluttered settings, map-based approaches demand heavy mapping effort, and learning-based solutions rely on large datasets with limited generalization. To address these challenges, we present Pareto-Optimal Visual Navigation, a lightweight image-space framework that combines data-driven semantics, Pareto-optimal decision-making, and visual servoing for real-time navigation.

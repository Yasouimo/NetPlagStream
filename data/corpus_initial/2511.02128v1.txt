Computational methods for predicting and designing biomolecular structures are increasingly powerful. While previous approaches relied on physics-based modeling, modern tools, such as AlphaFold2 in CASP14, leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to achieve significantly improved performance. The growing impact of AI-based tools in protein science necessitates enhanced educational materials that improve AI literacy among both established scientists seeking to deepen their expertise and new researchers entering the field. To address this need, we developed DL4Proteins, a series of ten interactive notebook modules that introduce fundamental machine learning (ML) concepts, guide users through training ML models for protein-related tasks, and ultimately present cutting-edge protein structure prediction and design pipelines. With nothing more than a web browser, learners can now access state-of-the-art computational tools employed by professional protein engineers - ranging from all-atom protein design to fine-tuning protein language models for biophysically relevant functional tasks. By increasing accessibility, this notebook series broadens participation in AI-driven protein research.

Wasserstein gradient flow provides a general framework for minimizing an energy functional $J$ over the space of probability measures on a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$. Its canonical time-discretization, the Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) scheme, produces for any step size $η>0$ a sequence of probability distributions $ρ_k^η$ that approximate to first order in $η$ Wasserstein gradient flow on $J$. But the JKO scheme also has many other remarkable properties not shared by other first order integrators, e.g. it preserves energy dissipation and exhibits unconditional stability for $λ$-geodesically convex functionals $J$. To better understand the JKO scheme we characterize its implicit bias at second order in $η$. We show that $ρ_k^η$ are approximated to order $η^2$ by Wasserstein gradient flow on a \emph{modified} energy \[ J^η(ρ) = J(ρ) - \fracη{4}\int_M \Big\lVert \nabla_g \frac{δJ}{δρ} (ρ) \Big\rVert_{2}^{2} \,ρ(dx), \] obtained by subtracting from $J$ the squared metric curvature of $J$ times $η/4$. The JKO scheme therefore adds at second order in $η$ a \textit{deceleration} in directions where the metric curvature of $J$ is rapidly changing. This corresponds to canonical implicit biases for common functionals: for entropy the implicit bias is the Fisher information, for KL-divergence it is the Fisher-Hyv{ä}rinen divergence, and for Riemannian gradient descent it is the kinetic energy in the metric $g$. To understand the differences between minimizing $J$ and $J^η$ we study \emph{JKO-Flow}, Wasserstein gradient flow on $J^η$, in several simple numerical examples. These include exactly solvable Langevin dynamics on the Bures-Wasserstein space and Langevin sampling from a quartic potential in 1D.

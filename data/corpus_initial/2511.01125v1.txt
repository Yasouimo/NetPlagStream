We introduce a mild generative variant of the classical neural operator model, which leverages Kolmogorov--Arnold networks to solve infinite families of second-order backward stochastic differential equations ($2$BSDEs) on regular bounded Euclidean domains with random terminal time. Our first main result shows that the solution operator associated with a broad range of $2$BSDE families is approximable by appropriate neural operator models. We then identify a structured subclass of (infinite) families of $2$BSDEs whose neural operator approximation requires only a polynomial number of parameters in the reciprocal approximation rate, as opposed to the exponential requirement in general worst-case neural operator guarantees.

Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) spectroscopy is a powerful and rapid technique widely used in medicine, material science, and chemical analyses. However, its effectiveness is hindered by the presence of a non-resonant background that interferes with and distorts the true Raman signal. Deep learning methods have been employed to reconstruct the true Raman spectrum from measured CARS data using labeled datasets. A more recent development integrates the domain knowledge of Kramers-Kronig relationships and smoothness constraints in the form of physics-informed loss functions. However, these deterministic models lack the ability to quantify uncertainty, an essential feature for reliable deployment in high-stakes scientific and biomedical applications. In this work, we evaluate and compare various uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques within the context of CARS-to-Raman signal reconstruction. Furthermore, we demonstrate that incorporating physics-informed constraints into these models improves their calibration, offering a promising path toward more trustworthy CARS data analysis.

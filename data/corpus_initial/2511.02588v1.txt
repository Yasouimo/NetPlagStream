Background: With the popularity of live streaming platforms at an all-time high, and many people turning to alternative venues for educational needs, this full research paper explores the viewership habits of software and game development live streams through the lens of informal education opportunities. Purpose: We investigate why developers watch software and game development live streams to understand the educational and social benefits they derive from this emerging form of informal learning. Methods: We implement a mixed-methods study combining survey data from 39 viewers and nine semi-structured interviews to analyze motivations, perceptions, and outcomes of watching development live streams. Findings: This research finds that viewers are motivated by both educational and social factors, with community engagement and informal mentorship as key motivations. Additionally, we find that technical learning draws initial interest, but social connections and co-working aspects sustain long-term engagement. Implications: Live streaming serves as a valuable informal learning tool that combines self-directed technical education with community support, which suggests that developers can leverage these platforms for continuous learning and professional growth outside of or in addition to traditional educational structures.

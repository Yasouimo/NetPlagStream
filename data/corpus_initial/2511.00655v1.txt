Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients without sharing raw data, yet its scalability is limited by synchronization overhead. Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) alleviates this issue by allowing clients to communicate independently, thereby improving wall-clock efficiency in large-scale, heterogeneous environments. However, this asynchrony introduces stale updates (client updates computed on outdated global models) that can destabilize optimization and hinder convergence. We propose FedRevive, an asynchronous FL framework that revives stale updates through data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD). FedRevive integrates parameter-space aggregation with a lightweight, server-side DFKD process that transfers knowledge from stale client models to the current global model without access to real or public data. A meta-learned generator synthesizes pseudo-samples, which enables multi-teacher distillation. A hybrid aggregation scheme that combines raw updates with DFKD updates effectively mitigates staleness while retaining the scalability of AFL. Experiments on various vision and text benchmarks show that FedRevive achieves faster training up to 32.1% and higher final accuracy up to 21.5% compared to asynchronous baselines.

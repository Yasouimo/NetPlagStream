This paper presents an expanded account of the Holistic Cognitive Development (HCD) framework for reflective and creative learning in computing education. The HCD framework integrates design thinking, experiential learning, and reflective practice into a unified constructivist pedagogy emphasizing autonomy, ownership, and scaffolding. It is applied across courses in game design (CS3247, CS4350), virtual reality (CS4240), and extended reality systems, where students engage in iterative cycles of thinking, creating, criticizing, and reflecting. The paper also examines how AI-augmented systems such as iReflect, ReflexAI, and Knowledge Graph-enhanced LLM feedback tools operationalize the HCD framework through scalable, personalized feedback. Empirical findings demonstrate improved reflective depth, feedback quality, and learner autonomy. The work advocates a balance of supportive autonomy in supervision, where students practice self-directed inquiry while guided through structured reflection and feedback.

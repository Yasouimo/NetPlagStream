Interpretable representation learning is a central challenge in modern machine learning, particularly in high-dimensional settings such as neuroimaging, genomics, and text analysis. Current methods often struggle to balance the competing demands of interpretability and model flexibility, limiting their effectiveness in extracting meaningful insights from complex data. We introduce Non-negative Stiefel Approximating Flow (NSA-Flow), a general-purpose matrix estimation framework that unifies ideas from sparse matrix factorization, orthogonalization, and constrained manifold learning. NSA-Flow enforces structured sparsity through a continuous balance between reconstruction fidelity and column-wise decorrelation, parameterized by a single tunable weight. The method operates as a smooth flow near the Stiefel manifold with proximal updates for non-negativity and adaptive gradient control, yielding representations that are simultaneously sparse, stable, and interpretable. Unlike classical regularization schemes, NSA-Flow provides an intuitive geometric mechanism for manipulating sparsity at the level of global structure while simplifying latent features. We demonstrate that the NSA-Flow objective can be optimized smoothly and integrates seamlessly with existing pipelines for dimensionality reduction while improving interpretability and generalization in both simulated and real biomedical data. Empirical validation on the Golub leukemia dataset and in Alzheimer's disease demonstrate that the NSA-Flow constraints can maintain or improve performance over related methods with little additional methodological effort. NSA-Flow offers a scalable, general-purpose tool for interpretable ML, applicable across data science domains.

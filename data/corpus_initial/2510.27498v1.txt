We study the problem of nonparametric two-sample testing using the sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance. While prior theoretical and empirical work indicates that the SW distance offers a promising balance between strong statistical guarantees and computational efficiency, its theoretical foundations for hypothesis testing remain limited. We address this gap by proposing a permutation-based SW test and analyzing its performance. The test inherits finite-sample Type I error control from the permutation principle. Moreover, we establish non-asymptotic power bounds and show that the procedure achieves the minimax separation rate $n^{-1/2}$ over multinomial and bounded-support alternatives, matching the optimal guarantees of kernel-based tests while building on the geometric foundations of Wasserstein distances. Our analysis further quantifies the trade-off between the number of projections and statistical power. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate that the test combines finite-sample validity with competitive power and scalability, and -- unlike kernel-based tests, which require careful kernel tuning -- it performs consistently well across all scenarios we consider.

This paper proposes MATT-Diff: Multi-Modal Active Target Tracking by Diffusion Policy, a control policy that captures multiple behavioral modes - exploration, dedicated tracking, and target reacquisition - for active multi-target tracking. The policy enables agent control without prior knowledge of target numbers, states, or dynamics. Effective target tracking demands balancing exploration for undetected or lost targets with following the motion of detected but uncertain ones. We generate a demonstration dataset from three expert planners including frontier-based exploration, an uncertainty-based hybrid planner switching between frontier-based exploration and RRT* tracking based on target uncertainty, and a time-based hybrid planner switching between exploration and tracking based on target detection time. We design a control policy utilizing a vision transformer for egocentric map tokenization and an attention mechanism to integrate variable target estimates represented by Gaussian densities. Trained as a diffusion model, the policy learns to generate multi-modal action sequences through a denoising process. Evaluations demonstrate MATT-Diff's superior tracking performance against expert and behavior cloning baselines across multiple target motions, empirically validating its advantages in target tracking.

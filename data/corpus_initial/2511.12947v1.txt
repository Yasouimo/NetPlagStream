Local-life recommendation have witnessed rapid growth, providing users with convenient access to daily essentials. However, this domain faces two key challenges: (1) spatial constraints, driven by the requirements of the local-life scenario, where items are usually shown only to users within a limited geographic area, indirectly reducing their exposure probability; and (2) long-tail sparsity, where few popular items dominate user interactions, while many high-quality long-tail items are largely overlooked due to imbalanced interaction opportunities. Existing methods typically adopt a user-centric perspective, such as modeling spatial user preferences or enhancing long-tail representations with collaborative filtering signals. However, we argue that an item-centric perspective is more suitable for this domain, focusing on enhancing long-tail items representation that align with the spatially-constrained characteristics of local lifestyle services. To tackle this issue, we propose ReST, a Plug-And-Play Spatially-Constrained Representation Enhancement Framework for Long-Tail Local-Life Recommendation. Specifically, we first introduce a Meta ID Warm-up Network, which initializes fundamental ID representations by injecting their basic attribute-level semantic information. Subsequently, we propose a novel Spatially-Constrained ID Representation Enhancement Network (SIDENet) based on contrastive learning, which incorporates two efficient strategies: a spatially-constrained hard sampling strategy and a dynamic representation alignment strategy. This design adaptively identifies weak ID representations based on their attribute-level information during training. It additionally enhances them by capturing latent item relationships within the spatially-constrained characteristics of local lifestyle services, while preserving compatibility with popular items.

The placement of Cloud-Native Network Functions (CNFs) across the Cloud-Continuum represents a core challenge in the orchestration of current 5G and future 6G networks. The process involves the placement of interdependent computing tasks, structured as Service Function Chains, over distributed cloud infrastructures. This is achieved while satisfying strict resource, bandwidth and latency constraints. It is acknowledged that classical approaches, including mixed-integer nonlinear programming, heuristics and reinforcement learning are limited in terms of scalability, constraint handling and generalisation capacity. In the present study, a novel theoretical framework is proposed, which is based on Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) for CNF placement. The present approach proposes a reconceptualisation of placement as a generative graph to assignment task, where the placement problem is encoded as a heterogeneous graph, and a Graph Neural Network denoiser is trained to iteratively refine noisy CNF-to-cloud assignment matrices. The model incorporates constraint-specific losses directly into the loss function, thereby allowing it to learn feasible solution spaces. The integration of the DDPM formulation with structured combinatorial constraints is achieved through a rigorous and systematic approach. Extensive evaluations across diverse topologies have been conducted, which have confirmed that the model consistently produces feasible solutions with orders of magnitude faster inference than MINLP solvers. The results obtained demonstrate the potential of diffusion-based generative modelling for constrained network embedding problems, making an impact towards the practical, scalable orchestration of distributed Cloud-Native Network Functions.

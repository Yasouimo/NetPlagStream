Transfer learning of tabular data is non-trivial due to heterogeneity in the feature space across disparate domains. The limited success of traditional deep learning in tabular knowledge transfer can be advanced by leveraging large language models (LLMs). However, the efficacy of LLMs often stagnates for mixed data types structured in tables due to the limitations of text prompts and in-context learning. We propose a lightweight transfer learning framework that fine-tunes an LLM using source tabular data and transplants the LLM's selective $key$ and $value$ projection weights into a gated feature tokenized transformer (gFTT) built for tabular data. The gFTT model with cross-domain attention is fine-tuned using target tabular data for transfer learning, eliminating the need for shared features, LLM prompt engineering, and large-scale pretrained models. Our experiments using ten pairs of source-target data sets and 12 baselines demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LLM-attention transplant for transfer learning (LATTLE) method over traditional ML models, state-of-the-art deep tabular architectures, and transfer learning models trained on thousands to billions of tabular samples. The proposed attention transfer demonstrates an effective solution to learning relationships between data tables using an LLM in a low-resource learning environment. The source code for the proposed method is publicly available.

Accurate and efficient global ocean state estimation remains a grand challenge for Earth system science, hindered by the dual bottlenecks of computational scalability and degraded data fidelity in traditional data assimilation (DA) and deep learning (DL) approaches. Here we present an AI-driven Data Assimilation Framework for Ocean (ADAF-Ocean) that directly assimilates multi-source and multi-scale observations, ranging from sparse in-situ measurements to 4 km satellite swaths, without any interpolation or data thinning. Inspired by Neural Processes, ADAF-Ocean learns a continuous mapping from heterogeneous inputs to ocean states, preserving native data fidelity. Through AI-driven super-resolution, it reconstructs 0.25$^\circ$ mesoscale dynamics from coarse 1$^\circ$ fields, which ensures both efficiency and scalability, with just 3.7\% more parameters than the 1$^\circ$ configuration. When coupled with a DL forecasting system, ADAF-Ocean extends global forecast skill by up to 20 days compared to baselines without assimilation. This framework establishes a computationally viable and scientifically rigorous pathway toward real-time, high-resolution Earth system monitoring.

Creating programs to represent board games can be a time-consuming task. Large Language Models (LLMs) arise as appealing tools to expedite this process, given their capacity to efficiently generate code from simple contextual information. In this work, we propose a method to test how capable three LLMs (Claude, DeepSeek and ChatGPT) are at creating code for board games, as well as new variants of existing games.

Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach to enabling collaborative model training without centralized data sharing, a crucial requirement in scientific domains where data privacy, ownership, and compliance constraints are critical. However, building user-friendly enterprise-level FL frameworks that are both scalable and privacy-preserving remains challenging, especially when bridging the gap between local prototyping and distributed deployment across heterogeneous client computing infrastructures. In this paper, based on our experiences building the Advanced Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (APPFL) framework, we present our vision for an enterprise-grade, privacy-preserving FL framework designed to scale seamlessly across computing environments. We identify several key capabilities that such a framework must provide: (1) Scalable local simulation and prototyping to accelerate experimentation and algorithm design; (2) seamless transition from simulation to deployment; (3) distributed deployment across diverse, real-world infrastructures, from personal devices to cloud clusters and HPC systems; (4) multi-level abstractions that balance ease of use and research flexibility; and (5) comprehensive privacy and security through techniques such as differential privacy, secure aggregation, robust authentication, and confidential computing. We further discuss architectural designs to realize these goals. This framework aims to bridge the gap between research prototypes and enterprise-scale deployment, enabling scalable, reliable, and privacy-preserving AI for science.

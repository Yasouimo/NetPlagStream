Image restoration (IR) aims to recover clean images from degraded observations. Despite remarkable progress, most existing methods focus on a single degradation type, whereas real-world images often suffer from multiple coexisting degradations, such as rain, noise, and haze coexisting in a single image, which limits their practical effectiveness. In this paper, we propose an adaptive multi-degradation image restoration network that reconstructs images by leveraging decoupled representations of degradation ingredients to guide path selection. Specifically, we design a degradation ingredient decoupling block (DIDBlock) in the encoder to separate degradation ingredients statistically by integrating spatial and frequency domain information, enhancing the recognition of multiple degradation types and making their feature representations independent. In addition, we present fusion block (FBlock) to integrate degradation information across all levels using learnable matrices. In the decoder, we further introduce a task adaptation block (TABlock) that dynamically activates or fuses functional branches based on the multi-degradation representation, flexibly selecting optimal restoration paths under diverse degradation conditions. The resulting tightly integrated architecture, termed IMDNet, is extensively validated through experiments, showing superior performance on multi-degradation restoration while maintaining strong competitiveness on single-degradation tasks.

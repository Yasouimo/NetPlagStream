This study examines students' naïve mindset (misconceptions) about video game development, idealized and inaccurate beliefs that shape an unrealistic understanding of the field. The research evaluated the effectiveness of a fifteen-hour-long lecture series delivered by industry professionals, designed to challenge this mindset and expose students to the complexities and realities of game production. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining qualitative analysis with a prototype quantitative tool developed to measure levels of misconception. Participants included students (n = 91) from diverse academic backgrounds interested in game creation and professionals (n = 94) working in the video game industry. Findings show that the intervention significantly reduced students' naïve beliefs while enhancing their motivation to pursue careers in the industry. Exposure to professional perspectives fostered a more realistic and informed mindset, taking into account the understanding of the technical, collaborative, and business aspects of game development. The results suggest that incorporating similar expert-led interventions early in game development education can improve learning outcomes, support informed career choices, and mitigate future professional disappointment.

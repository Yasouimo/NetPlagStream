Modern codebases evolve continuously: files are renamed or deleted; public APIs drift; behavior shifts within otherwise familiar modules. A model trained yesterday to map a developer's natural-language question to the exact set of repository file paths that matter will degrade tomorrow, even if the questions themselves look unchanged. In this paper we study, at system scale and across several widely used repositories, how to keep such a model fresh without surrendering retention on earlier code. We frame freshness as a form of domain drift between a base snapshot and the current HEAD, and we compare three families of update strategies: (A) Full Refresh, retraining the entire model at the new snapshot; (B) In-Context Learning (ICL) that injects recent deltas (raw git diffs or concise English summaries) at inference; and (C) Incremental Fine-Tuning (Inc-FT) on delta-derived training sets, with carefully controlled NEW:OLD mixing to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We contribute an alias-aware evaluation protocol that credits rename while never rewarding deleted paths, and a practical Forgetting Probe that quantifies residual emissions of obsolete paths. Across Flask, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Poetry, Inc-FT with old-aware mixes delivers the best overall balance on mixed sets, ICL with English delta summaries delivers the fastest new-code lift when training is not feasible, and Full Refresh remains the ceiling when maximum NEW accuracy matters. We also compare Git-diff Inc-FT to full-file Inc-FT, showing that diffs excel in rename/delete-heavy windows while full-file context wins in behavior-change-heavy windows.

With the widespread adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), effective path planning has become increasingly important. Although traditional search methods have been extensively applied, metaheuristic algorithms have gained popularity due to their efficiency and problem-specific heuristics. However, challenges such as premature convergence and lack of solution diversity still hinder their performance in complex scenarios. To address these issues, this paper proposes an Enhanced Multi-Strategy Dwarf Mongoose Optimization (EDMO) algorithm, tailored for three-dimensional UAV trajectory planning in dynamic and obstacle-rich environments. EDMO integrates three novel strategies: (1) a Dynamic Quantum Tunneling Optimization Strategy (DQTOS) to enable particles to probabilistically escape local optima; (2) a Bio-phototactic Dynamic Focusing Search Strategy (BDFSS) inspired by microbial phototaxis for adaptive local refinement; and (3) an Orthogonal Lens Opposition-Based Learning (OLOBL) strategy to enhance global exploration through structured dimensional recombination. EDMO is benchmarked on 39 standard test functions from CEC2017 and CEC2020, outperforming 14 advanced algorithms in convergence speed, robustness, and optimization accuracy. Furthermore, real-world validations on UAV three-dimensional path planning and three engineering design tasks confirm its practical applicability and effectiveness in field robotics missions requiring intelligent, adaptive, and time-efficient planning.

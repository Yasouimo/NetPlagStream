We first study the generalization error of models that use a fixed feature representation (frozen intermediate layers) followed by a trainable readout layer. This setting encompasses a range of architectures, from deep random-feature models to echo-state networks (ESNs) with recurrent dynamics. Working in the high-dimensional regime, we apply Random Matrix Theory to derive a closed-form expression for the asymptotic generalization error. We then apply this analysis to recurrent representations and obtain concise formula that characterize their performance. Surprisingly, we show that a linear ESN is equivalent to ridge regression with an exponentially time-weighted (''memory'') input covariance, revealing a clear inductive bias toward recent inputs. Experiments match predictions: ESNs win in low-sample, short-memory regimes, while ridge prevails with more data or long-range dependencies. Our methodology provides a general framework for analyzing overparameterized models and offers insights into the behavior of deep learning networks.

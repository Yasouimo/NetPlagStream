Recently, the number of malicious open-source packages in package repositories has been increasing dramatically. While major security scanners focus on identifying known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) in open-source packages, there are very few studies on detecting malicious packages. Malicious open-source package detection typically requires static, dynamic analysis, or both. Dynamic analysis is more effective as it can expose a package's behaviors at runtime. However, current dynamic analysis tools (e.g., ossf's package-analysis) lack an automatic method to differentiate malicious packages from benign packages. In this paper, we propose an approach to extract the features from dynamic analysis (e.g., executed commands) and leverage machine learning techniques to automatically classify packages as benign or malicious. Our evaluation of nearly 2000 packages on npm shows that the machine learning classifier achieves an AUC of 0.91 with a false positive rate of nearly 0%.

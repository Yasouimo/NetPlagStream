In the early stages of semiconductor equipment development, obtaining large quantities of raw optical images poses a significant challenge. This data scarcity hinder the advancement of AI-powered solutions in semiconductor manufacturing. To address this challenge, we introduce SinSEMI, a novel one-shot learning approach that generates diverse and highly realistic images from single optical image. SinSEMI employs a multi-scale flow-based model enhanced with LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity) energy guidance during sampling, ensuring both perceptual realism and output variety. We also introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework tailored for this application, which enables a thorough assessment using just two reference images. Through the evaluation against multiple one-shot generation techniques, we demonstrate SinSEMI's superior performance in visual quality, quantitative measures, and downstream tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that SinSEMI-generated images achieve both high fidelity and meaningful diversity, making them suitable as training data for semiconductor AI applications.

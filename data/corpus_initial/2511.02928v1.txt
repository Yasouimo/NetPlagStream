Glioma segmentation is critical for diagnosis and treatment planning, yet remains challenging in Sub-Saharan Africa due to limited MRI infrastructure and heterogeneous acquisition protocols that induce severe domain shift. We propose SegFormer3D-plus, a radiomics-guided transformer architecture designed for robust segmentation under domain variability. Our method combines: (1) histogram matching for intensity harmonization across scanners, (2) radiomic feature extraction with PCA-reduced k-means for domain-aware stratified sampling, (3) a dual-pathway encoder with frequency-aware feature extraction and spatial-channel attention, and (4) composite Dice-Cross-Entropy loss for boundary refinement. Pretrained on BraTS 2023 and fine-tuned on BraTS-Africa data, SegFormer3D-plus demonstrates improved tumor subregion delineation and boundary localization across heterogeneous African clinical scans, highlighting the value of radiomics-guided domain adaptation for resource-limited settings.

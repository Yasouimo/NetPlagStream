In Extended Reality (XR), rendering sound that accurately simulates real-world acoustics is pivotal in creating lifelike and believable virtual experiences. However, existing XR spatial audio rendering methods often struggle with real-time adaptation to diverse physical scenes, causing a sensory mismatch between visual and auditory cues that disrupts user immersion. To address this, we introduce SAMOSA, a novel on-device system that renders spatially accurate sound by dynamically adapting to its physical environment. SAMOSA leverages a synergistic multimodal scene representation by fusing real-time estimations of room geometry, surface materials, and semantic-driven acoustic context. This rich representation then enables efficient acoustic calibration via scene priors, allowing the system to synthesize a highly realistic Room Impulse Response (RIR). We validate our system through technical evaluation using acoustic metrics for RIR synthesis across various room configurations and sound types, alongside an expert evaluation (N=12). Evaluation results demonstrate SAMOSA's feasibility and efficacy in enhancing XR auditory realism.

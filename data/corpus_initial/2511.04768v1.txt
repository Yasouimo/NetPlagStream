As deep learning models scale, sparse computation and specialized dataflow hardware have emerged as powerful solutions to address efficiency. We propose FuseFlow, a compiler that converts sparse machine learning models written in PyTorch to fused sparse dataflow graphs for reconfigurable dataflow architectures (RDAs). FuseFlow is the first compiler to support general cross-expression fusion of sparse operations. In addition to fusion across kernels (expressions), FuseFlow also supports optimizations like parallelization, dataflow ordering, and sparsity blocking. It targets a cycle-accurate dataflow simulator for microarchitectural analysis of fusion strategies. We use FuseFlow for design-space exploration across four real-world machine learning applications with sparsity, showing that full fusion (entire cross-expression fusion across all computation in an end-to-end model) is not always optimal for sparse models-fusion granularity depends on the model itself. FuseFlow also provides a heuristic to identify and prune suboptimal configurations. Using Fuseflow, we achieve performance improvements, including a ~2.7x speedup over an unfused baseline for GPT-3 with BigBird block-sparse attention.

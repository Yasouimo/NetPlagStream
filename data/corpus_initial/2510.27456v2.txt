Study region: Ghana and Zambia, Africa
  Study focus: This study rigorously evaluates a suite of bias correction (BC) methods, including statistical approaches (LOCI, QM), machine learning (SVR, GPR), and hybrid techniques (LOCI-GPR, QM-GPR), applied to seven satellite rainfall estimates (SREs) across 38 stations in Ghana and Zambia, aiming to assess their performance in rainfall detection and intensity estimation.
  New hydrological insights for the region: Results indicate that the ENACTS product, which uniquely integrates a large number of station records, was the most corrigible SRE; in Zambia, nearly all BC methods successfully reduced the mean error in daily rainfall amounts at over 70\% of stations. However, this performance requires further validation at independent stations not incorporated into the ENACTS product. Overall, statistical methods (QM and LOCI) generally outperformed other techniques, although QM exhibited a tendency to inflate rainfall values. All SREs corrected with the statistical and hybrid BC methods demonstrated high capability for detecting dry days (POD $\ge$ 0.80). A critical limitation persisted, however, as all SREs (except ENACTS), after correction with BC methods, consistently failed to improve the detection of heavy and violent rainfall events (POD $\leq$ 0.2), highlighting a crucial area for future research.

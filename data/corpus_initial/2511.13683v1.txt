We study the task of learning mixed unitary channels using Fisher information, under different quantum resource assumptions including ancilla and concatenation. Our result shows that the asymptotic sample complexity scales as $\frac{r}{d\varepsilon^2}$, where $r$ is the rank of the channel (i.e.\ the number of different unitaries), $d$ is the dimension of the system, and $\varepsilon^2$ is the mean-square error. Thus the critical resource is the ancilla, which mirrors the result in~\cite{chen2022quantum} but in a more precise form, as we point out that $r$ is also important. Additionally, we demonstrate the practical potential of mixed unitary channels by showing that random mixed unitary channels are easy to learn.

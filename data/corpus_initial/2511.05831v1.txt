Beam halo formation poses a critical challenge for high-repetition-rate continuous-wave (CW) free-electron lasers (FELs), directly affecting beam quality and machine protection, as observed during the LCLS-II commissioning. We identify and experimentally validate a previously unrecognized three-step mechanism for halo generation in the photoinjector, arising from coupled longitudinal-transverse dynamics in the low-energy beam. Theoretical analysis reveals that (i) the RF buncher induces an energy-radius correlation, (ii) velocity bunching transforms this correlation into hollowed density structures in the bunch head and tail, and (iii) differential overfocusing of these hollowed regions by downstream focusing forms the observed halo. This mechanism is confirmed by particle-in-cell simulations and direct experimental measurements, including controlled formation of a core-ring profile via solenoid tuning. The results establish the physical origin of the halo and demonstrate a mitigation via buncher compression tuning that reduces halo and downstream loss, supporting sustained high-repetition-rate FEL operation.

This work addresses the inverse problem of espresso coffee extraction, in which one aims to reconstruct the brewing conditions that generate a desired chemical profile in the final beverage. Starting from a high-fidelity multiphysics percolation model, describing fluid flow, solute transport, solid, liquid reactions, and heat exchange within the coffee bed, we derive a reduced forward operator mapping controllable brewing parameters to the concentrations of the main chemical species in the cup. From a mathematical standpoint, we formalize the structural requirements for the local solvability of inverse problems, providing a minimal analytical condition for the existence of a (local) inverse map: continuous differentiability of the forward operator and a locally constant, nondegenerate Jacobian rank. Under these assumptions, the Constant Rank Theorem ensures that the image of the forward operator is a smooth embedded manifold on which well-defined local right-inverses exist.
  Extensive experiments, including off-grid validation, show that the learned inverse map accurately reconstructs brewing temperature, grind size, and powder composition. The resulting framework combines rigorous analytical guarantees with modern data-driven methods, providing a principled and computationally efficient solution to the inverse extraction problem and enabling personalised brewing, recipe optimisation, and integration into smart coffee-machine systems.

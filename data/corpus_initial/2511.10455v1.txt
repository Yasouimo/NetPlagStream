Accurate null depth retrieval is critical in nulling interferometry. However, achieving accurate null depth calibration is challenging due to various noise sources, instrumental imperfections, and the complexity of real observational environments. These challenges necessitate advanced calibration techniques that can efficiently handle such uncertainties while maintaining a high accuracy. This paper aims to incorporate machine-learning techniques with a Bayesian inference to improve the accuracy and efficiency of null depth retrieval in nulling interferometry. Specifically, it explores the use of neural posterior estimation (NPE) to develop models that overcome the computational limitations of conventional methods, such as numerical self-calibration (NSC), providing a more robust solution for accurate null depth calibration. An NPE-based model was developed, with a simulator that incorporates real data to better represent specific conditions. The model was tested on both synthetic and observational data from the LBTI nuller for evaluation. The NPE model successfully demonstrated improved efficiency, achieving results comparable to current methods in use. It achieved a null depth retrieval accuracy down to a few $10^{-4}$ on real observational data, matching the performance of conventional approaches while offering significant computational advantages, reducing the data retrieval time to one-quarter of the time required by self-calibration methods. The NPE model presents a practical and scalable solution for null depth calibration in nulling interferometry, offering substantial improvements in efficiency over existing methods with a better precision and application to other interferometric techniques.

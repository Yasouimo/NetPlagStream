Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) have become a vital technology for improving the spectrum and energy efficiency of forthcoming wireless networks. Nevertheless, practical implementation is obstructed by the excessive overhead associated with the frequent transmission of phase shift information (PSI) over bandwidth-constrained control lines. Current deep learning-based compression methods mitigate this problem but are constrained by elevated decoder complexity, inadequate flexibility to dynamic channels, and static compression ratios. This research presents a prompt-conditioned PSI compression system that integrates prompt learning inspired by large models into the PSI compression process to address these difficulties. A hybrid prompt technique that integrates soft prompt concatenation with feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) facilitates adaptive encoding across diverse signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), fading kinds, and compression ratios. Furthermore, a variable rate technique incorporates the compression ratio into the prompt embeddings through latent masking, enabling a singular model to adeptly balance reconstruction accuracy. Additionally, a lightweight depthwise convolutional gating (DWCG) decoder facilitates precise feature reconstruction with minimal complexity. Comprehensive simulations indicate that the proposed framework significantly reduces NMSE compared to traditional autoencoder baselines, while ensuring robustness across various channel circumstances and accommodating variable compression ratios within a single model. These findings underscore the framework's promise as a scalable and efficient solution for real-time IRS control in next-generation wireless networks.

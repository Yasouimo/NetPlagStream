Lexical tone is central to many languages but remains underexplored in self-supervised learning (SSL) speech models, especially beyond Mandarin. We study four languages with complex and diverse tone systems: Burmese, Thai, Lao, and Vietnamese, to examine how far such models listen for tone and how transfer operates in low-resource conditions. As a baseline reference, we estimate the temporal span of tone cues to be about 100 ms in Burmese and Thai, and about 180 ms in Lao and Vietnamese. Probes and gradient analyses on fine-tuned SSL models reveal that tone transfer varies by downstream task: automatic speech recognition fine-tuning aligns spans with language-specific tone cues, while prosody- and voice-related tasks bias the model toward overly long spans. These findings indicate that tone transfer is shaped by downstream task, highlighting task effects on temporal focus in tone modeling.

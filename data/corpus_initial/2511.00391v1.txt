Multimodal code generation has garnered significant interest within the research community. Despite the notable success of recent vision-language models (VLMs) on specialized tasks like Chart-to-code generation, their reliance on single-task training regimens fosters a narrow paradigm that hinders the development of generalized \textbf{VI}sio\textbf{N} \textbf{C}ode \textbf{I}ntelligence. In this work, we introduce \textbf{VinciCoder}, a unified multimodal code generation model that addresses this limitation via a two-stage training framework. We begin by constructing a large-scale Supervised Finetuning (SFT) corpus comprising 1.6M image-code pairs for tasks involving direct code generation and visual-based code refinement. Subsequently, we introduce a Visual Reinforcement Learning (ViRL) strategy, which employs a coarse-to-fine reward mechanism to improve visual fidelity by calculating visual similarity across local and global image patches. Extensive experiments on various multimodal code generation benchmarks demonstrate that VinciCoder achieves state-of-the-art performance, underscoring the effectiveness of our coarse-to-fine ViRL strategy.

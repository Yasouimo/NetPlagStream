Centralized Software-Defined Networking (cSDN) offers flexible and programmable control of networks but suffers from scalability and reliability issues due to its reliance on centralized controllers. Decentralized SDN (dSDN) alleviates these concerns by distributing control across multiple local controllers, yet this architecture remains highly vulnerable to Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel detection and mitigation framework tailored for dSDN environments. The framework leverages lightweight port-level statistics combined with prompt engineering and in-context learning, enabling the DeepSeek-v3 Large Language Model (LLM) to classify traffic as benign or malicious without requiring fine-tuning or retraining. Once an anomaly is detected, mitigation is enforced directly at the attacker's port, ensuring that malicious traffic is blocked at their origin while normal traffic remains unaffected. An automatic recovery mechanism restores normal operation after the attack inactivity, ensuring both security and availability. Experimental evaluation under diverse DDoS attack scenarios demonstrates that the proposed approach achieves near-perfect detection, with 99.99% accuracy, 99.97% precision, 100% recall, 99.98% F1-score, and an AUC of 1.0. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining distributed monitoring with zero-training LLM inference, providing a proactive and scalable defense mechanism for securing dSDN infrastructures against DDoS threats.

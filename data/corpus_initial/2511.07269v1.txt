Coastal communities can be exposed to risk from catastrophic storm-induced coastal hazards, causing major global losses each year. Recent advances in computational power have enabled the integration of machine learning (ML) into coastal hazard modeling, particularly for storm surge prediction. Given the potential variation in future climate and landscape conditions, efficient predictive models that can incorporate multiple future scenarios are needed. Existing studies built a framework for training ML models using storm surge simulation data under different potential future climate and landscape scenarios. However, storm surge simulation data under designed future scenarios require computationally expensive numerical simulations of synthetic storm suites over extensive geospatial grids. As the number of designed scenarios increases, the computational cost associated with both numerical simulation and ML training increases rapidly. This study introduces a cost-effective reduction strategy that incorporates new scenario data while minimizing computational burden. The approach reduces training data across three dimensions: (1) grid points, (2) input features, and (3) storm suite size. Reducing the storm suite size is especially effective in cutting simulation costs. Model performance was evaluated using different ML algorithms, showing consistent effectiveness. When trained on 5,000 of 80,000 grid points, 10 of 12 features, and 40 of 90 storms, the model achieved an R=0.93, comparable to that of models trained on the full dataset, with substantially lower computational expense.

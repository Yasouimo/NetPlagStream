Evolving borrower behaviors, shifting economic conditions, and changing regulatory landscapes continuously reshape the data distributions underlying modern credit-scoring systems. Conventional explainability techniques, such as SHAP, assume static data and fixed background distributions, making their explanations unstable and potentially unfair when concept drift occurs. This study addresses that challenge by developing adaptive explanation frameworks that recalibrate interpretability and fairness in dynamically evolving credit models. Using a multi-year credit dataset, we integrate predictive modeling via XGBoost with three adaptive SHAP variants: (A) per-slice explanation reweighting that adjusts for feature distribution shifts, (B) drift-aware SHAP rebaselining with sliding-window background samples, and (C) online surrogate calibration using incremental Ridge regression. Each method is benchmarked against static SHAP explanations using metrics of predictive performance (AUC, F1), directional and rank stability (cosine, Kendall tau), and fairness (demographic parity and recalibration). Results show that adaptive methods, particularly rebaselined and surrogate-based explanations, substantially improve temporal stability and reduce disparate impact across demographic groups without degrading predictive accuracy. Robustness tests, including counterfactual perturbations, background sensitivity analysis, and proxy-variable detection, confirm the resilience of adaptive explanations under real-world drift conditions. These findings establish adaptive explainability as a practical mechanism for sustaining transparency, accountability, and ethical reliability in data-driven credit systems, and more broadly, in any domain where decision models evolve with population change.

Multi-behavior recommendation aims to integrate users' interactions across various behavior types (e.g., view, favorite, add-to-cart, purchase) to more comprehensively characterize user preferences. However, existing methods lack in-depth modeling when dealing with interactions that generate only auxiliary behaviors without triggering the target behavior. In fact, these weak signals contain rich latent information and can be categorized into two types: (1) positive weak signals-items that have not triggered the target behavior but exhibit frequent auxiliary interactions, reflecting users' hesitation tendencies toward these items; and (2) negative weak signals-auxiliary behaviors that result from misoperations or interaction noise, which deviate from true preferences and may cause negative transfer effects. To more effectively identify and utilize these weak signals, we propose a recommendation framework focused on weak signal learning, termed HNT. Specifically, HNT models weak signal features from two dimensions: positive and negative effects. By learning the characteristics of auxiliary behaviors that lead to target behaviors, HNT identifies similar auxiliary behaviors that did not trigger the target behavior and constructs a hesitation set of related items as weak positive samples to enhance preference modeling, thereby capturing users' latent hesitation intentions. Meanwhile, during auxiliary feature fusion, HNT incorporates latent negative transfer effect modeling to distinguish and suppress interference caused by negative representations through item similarity learning. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HNT improves HR@10 and NDCG@10 by 12.57% and 14.37%, respectively, compared to the best baseline methods.

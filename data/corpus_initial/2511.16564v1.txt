The normalised decay rate of $B^+ \to J/ψ(\to μ^+μ^-) K^+$ is measured as a function of the lepton helicity angle using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $1.1 \text{fb}^{-1}$ collected during October 2024 with the upgraded (Upgrade I) LHCb detector. This angular distribution can be parameterised by two coefficients, the forward-backward asymmetry, $A_{FB}$, and the flatness parameter, $F_{H}$, whose values are constrained by conservation of angular momentum. These coefficients are measured both integrated and differentially across various kinematic and detector-response variables, and the results are found to be in good agreement with expectations. These measurements show that the detector response of the LHCb Upgrade I experiment is understood to the precision required to reliably extract the angular coefficients associated with rare $b \to s μ^+μ^-$ and $b \to d μ^+μ^-$ transitions, which are particularly sensitive to physics beyond the Standard Model.

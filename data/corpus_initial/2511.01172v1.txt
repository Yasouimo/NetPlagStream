Deep learning has emerged as a leading approach for Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC), demonstrating superior performance over traditional methods. However, vulnerability to adversarial attacks and susceptibility to data distribution shifts hinder their practical deployment in real-world, dynamic environments. To address these threats, we propose a novel, unified framework that integrates meta-learning with domain adaptation, making AMC systems resistant to both adversarial attacks and environmental changes. Our framework utilizes a two-phase strategy. First, in an offline phase, we employ a meta-learning approach to train the model on clean and adversarially perturbed samples from a single source domain. This method enables the model to generalize its defense, making it resistant to a combination of previously unseen attacks. Subsequently, in the online phase, we apply domain adaptation to align the model's features with a new target domain, allowing it to adapt without requiring substantial labeled data. As a result, our framework achieves a significant improvement in modulation classification accuracy against these combined threats, offering a critical solution to the deployment and operational challenges of modern AMC systems.

Training physics informed neural networks PINNs for hyperbolic conservation laws near the inviscid limit presents considerable difficulties because strong form residuals become ill posed at shock discontinuities, while small viscosity regularization introduces narrow boundary layers that exacerbate spectral bias. To address these issues this paper proposes a novel two stage adaptive lifting PINN, a lifting based framework designed to mitigate such challenges without requiring a priori knowledge of the interface geometry. The key idea is to augment the physical coordinates by introducing a learned auxiliary field generated through r adaptive coordinate transformations. Theoretically we first derive an a posteriori L2 error estimate to quantify how training difficulty depends on viscosity. Secondly we provide a statistical interpretation revealing that embedded sampling induces variance reduction analogous to importance sampling. Finally we perform an NTK and gradient flow analysis, demonstrating that input augmentation improves conditioning and accelerates residual decay. Supported by these insights our numerical experiments show accelerated and more stable convergence as well as accurate reconstructions near discontinuities.

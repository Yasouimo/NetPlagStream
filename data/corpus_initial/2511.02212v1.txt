This study presents a hybrid deep learning framework, the Vision Transformer with Residual Feature Network (VRF-Net), for recovering high-resolution system matrices in Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI). MPI resolution often suffers from downsampling and coil sensitivity variations. VRF-Net addresses these challenges by combining transformer-based global attention with residual convolutional refinement, enabling recovery of both large-scale structures and fine details. To reflect realistic MPI conditions, the system matrix is degraded using a dual-stage downsampling strategy. Training employed paired-image super-resolution on the public Open MPI dataset and a simulated dataset incorporating variable coil sensitivity profiles. For system matrix recovery on the Open MPI dataset, VRF-Net achieved nRMSE = 0.403, pSNR = 39.08 dB, and SSIM = 0.835 at 2x scaling, and maintained strong performance even at challenging scale 8x (pSNR = 31.06 dB, SSIM = 0.717). For the simulated dataset, VRF-Net achieved nRMSE = 4.44, pSNR = 28.52 dB, and SSIM = 0.771 at 2x scaling, with stable performance at higher scales. On average, it reduced nRMSE by 88.2%, increased pSNR by 44.7%, and improved SSIM by 34.3% over interpolation and CNN-based methods. In image reconstruction of Open MPI phantoms, VRF-Net further reduced reconstruction error to nRMSE = 1.79 at 2x scaling, while preserving structural fidelity (pSNR = 41.58 dB, SSIM = 0.960), outperforming existing methods. These findings demonstrate that VRF-Net enables sharper, artifact-free system matrix recovery and robust image reconstruction across multiple scales, offering a promising direction for future in vivo applications.

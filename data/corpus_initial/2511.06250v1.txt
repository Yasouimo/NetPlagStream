With the growing demand for high-quality image generation on resource-constrained devices, efficient diffusion models have received increasing attention. However, such models suffer from approximation errors introduced by efficiency techniques, which significantly degrade generation quality. Once deployed, these errors are difficult to correct, as modifying the model is typically infeasible in deployment environments. Through an analysis of error propagation across diffusion timesteps, we reveal that these approximation errors can accumulate exponentially, severely impairing output quality. Motivated by this insight, we propose Iterative Error Correction (IEC), a novel test-time method that mitigates inference-time errors by iteratively refining the model's output. IEC is theoretically proven to reduce error propagation from exponential to linear growth, without requiring any retraining or architectural changes. IEC can seamlessly integrate into the inference process of existing diffusion models, enabling a flexible trade-off between performance and efficiency. Extensive experiments show that IEC consistently improves generation quality across various datasets, efficiency techniques, and model architectures, establishing it as a practical and generalizable solution for test-time enhancement of efficient diffusion models.

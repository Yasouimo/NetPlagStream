Recent advances in Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs) have paved the way for unified architectures across diverse speech understanding tasks. However, prevailing alignment paradigms rely heavily on large-scale audio-text paired data and computationally intensive training, yet often exhibit limited generalization to unseen domains or tasks. To address these limitations, we propose TASU (Text-only Alignment for Speech Understanding), a novel alignment paradigm that can leverage only unpaired text data to guide cross-modal alignment. Experiments show that TASU achieves competitive zero-shot speech recognition. Leveraging this property, it can further function as a pre-training stage in curriculum learning, enhancing domain generalization in speech recognition. Ultimately, TASU can extend its zero-shot generalization to a wide range of speech understanding tasks and notably outperforms prominent Speech LLMs including GLM-4-Voice and Step-Audio on the MMSU benchmark, establishing TASU as an efficient and scalable alignment paradigm for Speech LLMs.

Physiological motion can affect the diagnostic quality of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While various retrospective motion correction methods exist, many struggle to generalize across different motion types and body regions. In particular, machine learning (ML)-based corrections are often tailored to specific applications and datasets. We hypothesize that motion artifacts, though diverse, share underlying patterns that can be disentangled and exploited. To address this, we propose a hierarchical vector-quantized (VQ) variational auto-encoder that learns a disentangled embedding of motion-to-clean image features. A codebook is deployed to capture finite collection of motion patterns at multiple resolutions, enabling coarse-to-fine correction. An auto-regressive model is trained to learn the prior distribution of motion-free images and is used at inference to guide the correction process. Unlike conventional approaches, our method does not require artifact-specific training and can generalize to unseen motion patterns. We demonstrate the approach on simulated whole-body motion artifacts and observe robust correction across varying motion severity. Our results suggest that the model effectively disentangled physical motion of the simulated motion-effective scans, therefore, improving the generalizability of the ML-based MRI motion correction. Our work of disentangling the motion features shed a light on its potential application across anatomical regions and motion types.

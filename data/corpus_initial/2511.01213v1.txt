The immense diversity in the culture and culinary of Indian cuisines calls attention to the major shortcoming of the existing Visual Question Answering(VQA) systems which are inclined towards the foods from Western region. Recent attempt towards building a VQA dataset for Indian food is a step towards addressing this challenge. However, their approach towards VQA follows a two-step process in which the answer is generated first, followed by the explanation of the expected answer. In this work, we claim that food VQA requires to follow a multi-step reasoning process to arrive at an accurate answer, especially in the context of India food, which involves understanding complex culinary context and identifying relationships between various food items. With this hypothesis we create reasoning chains upon the QA with minimal human intervention. We fine-tune smaller LLMs and VLMs with auto-validated reasoning chains and further train them using reinforcement learning with larger data. With augmentation of reasoning chains, we observed accuracy improvement of an average 10 percentage points on the baseline. We provide detailed analysis in terms the effect of addition of reasoning chains for the Indian Food VQA task.

Quantum machine learning (QML) is a promising paradigm for tackling computational problems that challenge classical AI. Yet, the inherent probabilistic behavior of quantum mechanics, device noise in NISQ hardware, and hybrid quantum-classical execution pipelines introduce new risks that prevent reliable deployment of QML in real-world, safety-critical settings. This research offers a broad roadmap for Trustworthy Quantum Machine Learning (TQML), integrating three foundational pillars of reliability: (i) uncertainty quantification for calibrated and risk-aware decision making, (ii) adversarial robustness against classical and quantum-native threat models, and (iii) privacy preservation in distributed and delegated quantum learning scenarios. We formalize quantum-specific trust metrics grounded in quantum information theory, including a variance-based decomposition of predictive uncertainty, trace-distance-bounded robustness, and differential privacy for hybrid learning channels. To demonstrate feasibility on current NISQ devices, we validate a unified trust assessment pipeline on parameterized quantum classifiers, uncovering correlations between uncertainty and prediction risk, an asymmetry in attack vulnerability between classical and quantum state perturbations, and privacy-utility trade-offs driven by shot noise and quantum channel noise. This roadmap seeks to define trustworthiness as a first-class design objective for quantum AI.

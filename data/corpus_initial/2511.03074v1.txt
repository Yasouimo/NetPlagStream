Online learning to rank (OLTR) studies how to recommend a short ranked list of items from a large pool and improves future rankings based on user clicks. This setting is commonly modeled as cascading bandits, where the objective is to maximize the likelihood that the user clicks on at least one of the presented items across as many timesteps as possible. However, such systems are vulnerable to click fraud and other manipulations (i.e., corruption), where bots or paid click farms inject corrupted feedback that misleads the learning process and degrades user experience. In this paper, we propose MSUCB, a robust algorithm that incorporates a novel mean-of-medians estimator, which to our knowledge is applied to bandits with corruption setting for the first time. This estimator behaves like a standard mean in the absence of corruption, so no cost is paid for robustness. Under corruption, the median step filters out outliers and corrupted samples, keeping the estimate close to its true value. Updating this estimate at every round further accelerates empirical convergence in experiments. Hence, MSUCB achieves optimal logarithmic regret in the absence of corruption and degrades gracefully under corruptions, with regret increasing only by an additive term tied to the total corruption. Comprehensive and extensive experiments on real-world datasets further demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms prior methods while maintaining strong robustness. In particular, it achieves a \(97.35\%\) and a \(91.60\%\) regret improvement over two state-of-the-art methods.

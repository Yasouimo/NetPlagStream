Old cloud edge workload resource management is too reactive. The problem with relying on static thresholds is that we are either overspending for more resources than needed or have reduced performance because of their lack. This is why we work on proactive solutions. A framework developed for it stops reacting to the problems but starts expecting them. We design a hybrid architecture, combining two powerful tools: the CNN LSTM model for time series forecasting and an orchestrator based on multi agent Deep Reinforcement Learning In fact the novelty is in how we combine them as we embed the predictive forecast from the CNN LSTM directly into the DRL agent state space. That is what makes the AI manager smarter it sees the future, which allows it to make better decisions about a long term plan for where to run tasks That means finding that sweet spot between how much money is saved while keeping the system healthy and apps fast for users That is we have given it eyes in order to see down the road so that it does not have to lurch from one problem to another it finds a smooth path forward Our tests show our system easily beats the old methods It is great at solving tough problems like making complex decisions and juggling multiple goals at once like being cheap fast and reliable

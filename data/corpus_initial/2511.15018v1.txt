We develop a game-theoretic framework for adversarially robust optimal safe predefined-time stabilization of parameter-dependent nonlinear dynamical systems with nonquadratic cost functionals. Our approach ensures that all system trajectories remain within a specified admissible set and converge to equilibrium in a predefined time despite adversarial disturbances. The control problem is formulated as a two-player zero-sum differential game, where the controller is a minimizing player and the adversary a maximizing player. We derive sufficient conditions for the existence of a saddle-point solution and safe predefined-time stability using a barrier Lyapunov function that satisfies a differential inequality and the steady-state Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equation. To address the analytical intractability of solving the HJI equation, we introduce a physics-informed learning algorithm that robustly learns the Nash safely predefined-time stabilizing control strategy. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy and resilience of the proposed method in ensuring robust optimal safe predefined-time stabilization under adversarial disturbances.

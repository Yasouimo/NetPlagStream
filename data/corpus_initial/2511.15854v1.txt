We present discretize_distributions, a Python package that efficiently constructs discrete approximations of Gaussian mixture distributions and provides guarantees on the approximation error in Wasserstein distance. The package implements state-of-the-art quantization methods for Gaussian mixture models and extends them to improve scalability. It further integrates complementary quantization strategies such as sigma-point methods and provides a modular interface that supports custom schemes and integration into control and verification pipelines for cyber-physical systems. We benchmark the package on various examples, including high-dimensional, large, and degenerate Gaussian mixtures, and demonstrate that discretize_distributions produces accurate approximations at low computational cost.

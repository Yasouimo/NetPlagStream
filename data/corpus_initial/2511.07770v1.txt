Radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting exploits hardware imperfections for device identification, but distinguishing between same-model devices remains challenging due to their minimal hardware variations. Existing datasets for RF fingerprinting are constrained by small device scales and heterogeneous models, which hinders robust training and fair evaluation for machine learning models. To address this gap, we introduce a large-scale dataset of same-model devices along with a fully reproducible, open-source experimental framework. The dataset is built using 123 identical commercial IEEE 802.11g devices and contains 35.42 million raw I/Q samples from the preambles and corresponding 1.85 million RF features. The open-source framework further ensures full reproducibility from data collection to final evaluation. Within this framework, a Random Forest-based algorithm is proposed to achieve 89.06% identification accuracy on this dataset. Extensive experimental evaluations further confirm the relationships between the extracted features.

In the next 5 to 10 years, new fourth generation light sources will be coming online either from upgrades or as brand new facilities. The question regarding the competitiveness and the usability of a third generation light source is certainly in the mind of the scientific personnel, which includes both the beamline and the accelerator staff of any third Gen Research Infrastructures. At the Canadian Light Source (CLS), Accelerator Operation and Development (AOD) staff are responsible for the daily operation of the machines, their upgrades which extend to long term development and shall also raise awareness on their possibilities. The boundaries of this mind experiment are 1) we must use CLS infrastructure, 2) identify the existence of the knowledge to realize an idea, 3) the realization, with whom, how, with which funds and under which administrative supervision is out of bounds.

Adversarial attacks present a critical challenge to deep neural networks' robustness, particularly in transfer scenarios across different model architectures. However, the transferability of adversarial attacks faces a fundamental dilemma between Exploitation (maximizing attack potency) and Exploration (enhancing cross-model generalization). Traditional momentum-based methods over-prioritize Exploitation, i.e., higher loss maxima for attack potency but weakened generalization (narrow loss surface). Conversely, recent methods with inner-iteration sampling over-prioritize Exploration, i.e., flatter loss surfaces for cross-model generalization but weakened attack potency (suboptimal local maxima). To resolve this dilemma, we propose a simple yet effective Gradient-Guided Sampling (GGS), which harmonizes both objectives through guiding sampling along the gradient ascent direction to improve both sampling efficiency and stability. Specifically, based on MI-FGSM, GGS introduces inner-iteration random sampling and guides the sampling direction using the gradient from the previous inner-iteration (the sampling's magnitude is determined by a random distribution). This mechanism encourages adversarial examples to reside in balanced regions with both flatness for cross-model generalization and higher local maxima for strong attack potency. Comprehensive experiments across multiple DNN architectures and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art transfer attacks.

Computer Science (CS) education is expanding rapidly, but educators continue to face persistent challenges in teaching and learning environments.Despite growing interest, limited systematic work exists to categorize and synthesize the specific challenges faced by CS educators and the remedies adopted in response.This is problematic because it remains unclear which areas have been thoroughly addressed and which still lack sufficient scholarly attention. In this study, we conducted a structured literature review of peer-reviewed research papers published over the last five years, focusing on challenges and remedies across ten categorized themes, including pedagogical, emotional, technological, and institutional dimensions.Our analysis revealed recurring issues in areas such as assessment practices, teacher training, classroom management, and emotional well-being, along with various strategies such as professional development programs and policy interventions adopted to mitigate them while also revealing several areas that have received insufficient attention.This review offers a consolidated understanding of the CS education landscape, providing valuable insights for researchers, curriculum designers, and policymakers aiming to improve teaching effectiveness and educator support.

The promise of fault-tolerant quantum computing is challenged by environmental drift that relentlessly degrades the quality of quantum operations. The contemporary solution, halting the entire quantum computation for recalibration, is unsustainable for the long runtimes of the future algorithms. We address this challenge by unifying calibration with computation, granting the quantum error correction process a dual role: its error detection events are not only used to correct the logical quantum state, but are also repurposed as a learning signal, teaching a reinforcement learning agent to continuously steer the physical control parameters and stabilize the quantum system during the computation. We experimentally demonstrate this framework on a superconducting processor, improving the logical error rate stability of the surface code 3.5-fold against injected drift and pushing the performance beyond what is achievable with state-of-the-art traditional calibration and human-expert tuning. Simulations of surface codes up to distance-15 confirm the scalability of our method, revealing an optimization speed that is independent of the system size. This work thus enables a new paradigm: a quantum computer that learns to self-improve directly from its errors and never stops computing.

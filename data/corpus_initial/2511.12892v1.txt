In post-disaster space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs), terrestrial infrastructure is often impaired, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must rapidly restore connectivity for mission-critical ground terminals in cluttered non-line-of-sight (NLoS) urban environments. To enhance coverage, UAVs employ movable antennas (MAs), while reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) on surviving high-rises redirect signals. The key challenge is communication-limited partial observability, leaving each UAV with a narrow, fast-changing neighborhood view that destabilizes value estimation. Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches are inadequate--non-communication methods rely on unavailable global critics, heuristic sharing is brittle and redundant, and learnable protocols (e.g., CommNet, DIAL) lose per-neighbor structure and aggravate non-stationarity under tight bandwidth. To address partial observability, we propose a spatiotemporal A2C where each UAV transmits prior-decision messages with local state, a compact policy fingerprint, and a recurrent belief, encoded per neighbor and concatenated. A spatial discount shapes value targets to emphasize local interactions, while analysis under one-hop-per-slot latency explains stable training with delayed views. Experimental results show our policy outperforms IA2C, ConseNet, FPrint, DIAL, and CommNet--achieving faster convergence, higher asymptotic reward, reduced Temporal-Difference(TD)/advantage errors, and a better communication throughput-energy trade-off.

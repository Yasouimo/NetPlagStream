Object recognition plays a fundamental role in how biological organisms perceive and interact with their environment. While the human visual system performs this task with remarkable efficiency, reproducing similar capabilities in artificial systems remains challenging. This study investigates VisNet, a biologically inspired neural network model, and several enhanced variants incorporating radial basis function neurons, Mahalanobis distance based learning, and retinal like preprocessing for both general object recognition and symmetry classification. By leveraging principles of Hebbian learning and temporal continuity associating temporally adjacent views to build invariant representations. VisNet and its extensions capture robust and transformation invariant features. Experimental results across multiple datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR10, and custom symmetric object sets, show that these enhanced VisNet variants substantially improve recognition accuracy compared with the baseline model. These findings underscore the adaptability and biological relevance of VisNet inspired architectures, offering a powerful and interpretable framework for visual recognition in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.
